# 04.1 Mesh Generation Troubleshooting Log

## Expected Behavior (Acceptance Criteria)

- Mesh generation is performed asynchronously using a thread pool/job queue; the main thread only uploads finished meshes.
- Only visible faces are meshed: faces between solid blocks (even across chunk/segment borders) are not rendered, and faces at the world edge are only rendered if truly exposed.
- The number of unnecessary faces rendered is minimized, especially at chunk borders and world edges.
- The system remains responsive and mesh updates are correct and efficient, even under heavy load (many dirty segments).
- No visual artifacts or missing faces at chunk borders, overhangs, or world edges.
