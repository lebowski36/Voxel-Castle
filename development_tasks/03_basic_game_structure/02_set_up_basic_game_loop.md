# Task: Set Up Basic Game Loop

**Date Created:** 2025-05-12
**Status:** Not Started
**Depends On:** Window Management
**Leads To:** Game Logic Execution, Rendering Synchronization

## 1. Overview
This task involves implementing the fundamental game loop, which will drive game updates and rendering.

## 2. Goals
*   Implement a game loop with distinct update and render phases.
*   Consider fixed timestep for updates and variable for rendering.

## 3. Sub-Tasks
*   [ ] **3.1.** Design game loop structure (e.g., fixed update timestep, variable render timestep).
*   [ ] **3.2.** Implement the main loop in the application.
*   [ ] **3.3.** Create placeholders for `update()` and `render()` phases.
*   [ ] **3.4.** Integrate with window event processing.

## 4. Notes
*   The sub-tasks from `CURRENT_TODO.md` for the game loop are to be detailed here.
