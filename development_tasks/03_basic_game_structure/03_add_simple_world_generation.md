# Task: Add Simple World Generation

**Date Created:** 2025-05-12
**Status:** Not Started
**Depends On:** Voxel Data Structures, Chunk Management
**Leads To:** Procedural Content, Initial Game World

## 1. Overview
This task focuses on implementing a basic procedural world generation system to populate the game world with voxel terrain.

## 2. Goals
*   Implement a noise-based terrain generation algorithm (e.g., Perlin, Simplex).
*   Generate initial chunk structures based on this noise.

## 3. Sub-Tasks
*   [ ] **3.1.** Choose and integrate a noise library or implement a simple noise function.
*   [ ] **3.2.** Design how noise values map to voxel types (e.g., heightmap-based generation).
*   [ ] **3.3.** Implement logic in `WorldManager` or a dedicated `WorldGenerator` to fill `ChunkSegment`s with procedurally generated voxels.
*   [ ] **3.4.** Test generation by creating a few chunks and inspecting their voxel data (or visually, once rendering is available).

## 4. Notes
*   The sub-tasks from `CURRENT_TODO.md` for world generation are to be detailed here.
