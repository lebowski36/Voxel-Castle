# Task: Implement Basic Lighting Model

**Date Created:** 2025-05-12
**Status:** Not Started
**Depends On:** Mesh Generation, Rendering Pipeline
**Leads To:** Improved Visuals, Atmosphere

## 1. Overview
This task involves implementing a simple lighting model to enhance the visual appearance of the rendered voxel world.

## 2. Goals
*   Implement a basic lighting model (e.g., ambient light, directional light).
*   Update shaders to incorporate lighting calculations.

## 3. Sub-Tasks
*   [ ] **3.1.** Decide on the initial lighting model (e.g., simple directional light + ambient light).
*   [ ] **3.2.** Update vertex structure and mesh generation if normal data is not yet sufficient or correctly calculated for lighting.
*   [ ] **3.3.** Modify shaders (vertex and fragment) to perform basic lighting calculations.
*   [ ] **3.4.** Pass necessary lighting information (e.g., light direction, color, intensity) to shaders via uniforms.
*   [ ] **3.5.** Test by observing the effect of light on rendered meshes.

## 4. Notes
*   The sub-tasks from `CURRENT_TODO.md` for the lighting model are to be detailed here.
