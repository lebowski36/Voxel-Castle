# Task: Implement Basic Lighting Model

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

## Overview
Create a basic lighting system to enhance visual appearance of voxel world with ambient and directional lighting.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Analysis ✅ COMPLETE
**Status: COMPLETE** - Reviewed existing lighting infrastructure in shaders and mesh renderer.

- [x] Review vertex shader for lighting inputs (confirmed: `aLight` input exists)
- [x] Analyze fragment shader lighting capabilities (confirmed: lighting code was commented out)  
- [x] Check mesh renderer for lighting uniform support (confirmed: uniforms implemented)
- [x] Verify mesh generation includes lighting values (confirmed: lighting values calculated)

**Findings:**
- Vertex shader: Has `aLight` input and passes lighting to fragment shader as `vLight`
- Fragment shader: Had lighting uniforms defined but lighting calculation was commented out
- MeshRenderer: Already had lighting uniform locations and setup code
- VoxelMesh: Lighting values are calculated during mesh generation

### Phase 2: Basic Lighting Implementation ✅ COMPLETE  
**Status: COMPLETE** - Implemented Lambert diffuse lighting with ambient component.

- [x] Implement Lambert diffuse lighting calculation in fragment shader
- [x] Add ambient lighting component for base illumination
- [x] Set up lighting uniforms (direction, colors, strength)
- [x] Configure reasonable default lighting parameters

**Implementation Details:**
- Updated fragment shader with complete lighting calculation: `ambient + Lambert diffuse`
- Added lighting uniforms: `uLightDirection`, `uLightColor`, `uAmbientColor`, `uAmbientStrength`
- Set lighting parameters: sun direction (-0.3, -1.0, -0.2), warm white sun, cool blue ambient, 50% ambient strength

### Phase 3: Testing & Refinement ✅ COMPLETE
**Status: COMPLETE** - Verified lighting works and fixed visibility issues.

- [x] Build and test lighting system
- [x] Verify different face orientations receive appropriate lighting
- [x] Fine-tune lighting parameters for good visibility
- [x] Ensure no faces appear completely dark or grey

**Final Parameters:**
- Light Direction: (-0.3, -1.0, -0.2) - More top-down for even coverage
- Ambient Strength: 50% - Ensures good base visibility
- Ambient Color: (0.4, 0.5, 0.7) - Bright cool blue
- Light Color: (1.0, 0.95, 0.8) - Warm white sun

## Success Criteria ✅ ALL MET
- [x] Directional lighting affects face brightness based on orientation
- [x] Ambient lighting provides base illumination to prevent pure black faces  
- [x] All voxel faces remain visible with texture detail
- [x] Lighting enhances visual depth and dimension of the world

## Key Files Modified
- `/assets/shaders/voxel.frag` - Added complete lighting calculation
- `/engine/src/rendering/mesh_renderer.cpp` - Tuned lighting parameters

## Completion Notes
**TASK COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY** - Basic lighting model has been implemented and tested. The system provides:

1. **Directional Lighting**: Sun-like directional light creates realistic shading
2. **Ambient Lighting**: 50% ambient ensures all faces remain visible
3. **Visual Enhancement**: Lighting adds depth and dimension to the voxel world
4. **Parameter Balance**: Final tuning resolved grey face visibility issues

The lighting system is now functional and enhances the visual appearance of the voxel world while maintaining good visibility of all surfaces.
