# Task: Implement Camera System & Initial Mesh Rendering

**Date Created:** 2025-05-12
**Status:** Not Started
**Depends On:** Mesh Generation System, Rendering API Setup
**Leads To:** Visual Output, Further Rendering Enhancements

## 1. Overview
This task covers the implementation of a camera system and the initial steps to render a generated voxel mesh. This will provide the first visual feedback from the engine.

## 2. Goals
*   Implement a functional camera (perspective/orthographic).
*   Add basic camera controls.
*   Render a test mesh to verify the camera and basic rendering pipeline.
*   Handle window resizing.

## 3. Sub-Tasks

### 3.1. Prepare for Rendering
    *   [x] **3.1.1.** Define a simple `MeshRenderer` class or functions to upload mesh data (vertices, indices) to OpenGL buffers (VBO, VAO, EBO).
    *   [ ] **3.1.2.** Ensure the mesh vertex structure matches the shader input (position, normal, UV if needed).

### 3.2. Basic Shaders
    *   [ ] **3.2.1.** Create a simple vertex shader and fragment shader for colored or basic lit rendering.
    *   [ ] **3.2.2.** Load and compile shaders at startup.

### 3.3. Camera Implementation (Flying Spectator Camera)
    *   [x] **3.3.1.** Create a `SpectatorCamera` class/struct:
        *   Manages position, orientation (yaw, pitch), and view/projection matrices.
        *   Supports perspective projection.
    *   [x] **3.3.2.** Implement mouse look for free rotation (yaw/pitch, clamp pitch).
        *   Mouse is captured and hidden while focused; Escape releases/captures mouse.
        *   Standard FPS Y (up = look up).
    *   [x] **3.3.3.** Implement WASD (and QE/up-down) movement, speed adjustable, no collision (flying mode).
        *   WASD = horizontal, QE or Space/Ctrl = up/down, Shift = fast.
    *   [ ] **3.3.4.** Integrate camera with rendering pipeline (pass view/projection to shaders).
    *   [ ] **3.3.5.** Handle window resizing and update camera aspect ratio.
    *   [ ] **3.3.6.** (Optional) Implement frustum culling.

### 3.4. Integrate Mesh Generation and Rendering
    *   [ ] **3.4.1.** In the main loop (or a test setup), generate a test chunk and build its mesh (e.g., using the greedy meshing system).
    *   [ ] **3.4.2.** Upload the mesh to OpenGL buffers using the `MeshRenderer`.
    *   [ ] **3.4.3.** Render the mesh each frame, applying camera transformations.

### 3.5. Test and Verify
    *   [ ] **3.5.1.** Build and run the project.
    *   [ ] **3.5.2.** Confirm that a voxel mesh appears in the window and responds to camera controls.
    *   [ ] **3.5.3.** Adjust camera or mesh as needed for visibility.

## 4. Notes
*   Use a simple colored output for now; texture mapping can be added later.
*   Keep the rendering code modular so it can be extended for chunk streaming, LOD, etc.
*   The sub-tasks from `CURRENT_TODO.md` for the camera system are integrated here.
