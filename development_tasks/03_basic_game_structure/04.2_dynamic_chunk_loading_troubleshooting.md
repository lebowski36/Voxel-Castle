# 04.2 Dynamic Chunk Loading Troubleshooting Log

## Expected Behavior (Acceptance Criteria)

- As the camera/player moves, new chunks should be dynamically loaded and generated around the camera position.
- The visible world should extend beyond the initial starting chunk, with adjacent chunks appearing and being meshed as the camera approaches their boundaries.
- Chunks should be seamlessly added and removed from memory/rendering as the camera moves, maintaining a consistent world around the player.
- There should be no large empty voids or missing terrain near the camera unless at the true world edge.

## Troubleshooting Log

## [2025-05-15] Sidenote: Changed dynamic chunk loading to call `updateActiveChunks` every frame, not just on segment change. This ensures chunks are loaded even for small camera movements or when starting above empty space. Please verify that chunks now load and unload dynamically as you move the camera.


---

## [2025-05-15] Sidenote: Static chunk creation code has been removed and dynamic chunk loading is now enabled in the main loop. See code patches for details. Please verify world expansion and chunk streaming as you move the camera. Log any further issues below.

## [2025-05-15] Issue: Only world center chunk is rendered

- **Observation:** Only the chunk at the world center (e.g., (0,0,0) or (1,1,1)) is visible. No new chunks appear as the camera moves.
- **Expected:** Chunks should be loaded/unloaded dynamically around the camera/player position.
- **Action:** Remove hardcoded/static world center chunk. Activate dynamic chunk loading by ensuring `WorldManager::updateActiveChunks` is called every frame (or on camera movement) with the camera's position and a suitable load radius. This will cause chunks to be generated and loaded as the camera moves.

## Resolution Steps

1. Remove any code that creates or renders only a single static chunk at the world center.
2. Ensure the main game loop or update function calls `WorldManager::updateActiveChunks(cameraPosition, loadRadius, worldGenerator)`.
3. Test by moving the cameraâ€”new chunks should appear and old ones should unload as expected.
4. Update this log with results and any further issues.
