This document outlines the plan for creating a highly detailed and dynamic world generation system for Voxel Fortress, incorporating realistic geological and ecological features, and potentially historical simulation. This builds upon the initial simple world generation (2D heightmap based) and aims to achieve results comparable to advanced procedural generation found in games like Dwarf Fortress or sophisticated Minecraft mods.

## I. Research & Foundational Concepts (Recap & Expansion)

This section summarizes key research findings and guiding principles for advanced world generation.

### A. Core Inspirations & Goals:
-   **Dwarf Fortress:** Deep world history, complex geology, emergent narratives from world structure.
-   **Minecraft (Advanced Mods):** Realistic erosion, flowing rivers, diverse biomes, complex cave systems.
-   **Voxel Fortress Vision:**
    -   "Deep geological simulation creates realistic terrain with appropriate resource distribution."
    -   "Biome systems determine flora, fauna, and environmental conditions."
    -   "Historical generation creates context through pre-existing civilizations and ruins."
    -   "Fluid dynamics simulate water and lava flows."

### B. Key Methodologies Identified:
1.  **Layered Generation:** Build world from macro (continents) to micro (local details) scales.
2.  **Noise Functions as Base:** Utilize Perlin, Simplex, OpenSimplex, Worley, often combined and domain-warped.
3.  **Simulation for Naturalism:**
    -   **Hydraulic Erosion:** Simulates water flow eroding terrain, carving valleys, forming riverbeds. (Particle-based or flow-map approaches).
    -   **Thermal Erosion:** Simulates rock weathering, softening sharp features.
    -   **Tectonic Simulation (Highly Advanced):** Simulating plate tectonics for continent formation.
4.  **Climate Simulation:** Model temperature, rainfall based on latitude, altitude, oceans, wind.
5.  **Biome Mapping:** Define biomes based on climate parameters.
6.  **River Networks:** Simulate water collection and flow from high points to oceans/lakes.
7.  **Historical Simulation (Dwarf Fortress style):** Simulate civilizations, events, ruins on top of the physical world.
8.  **Heightmaps for Large Scale, Voxelization for Detail:** Many large-scale processes (erosion, initial rivers) can be efficiently simulated on 2D heightmaps, then translated/refined into 3D voxel space. True 3D simulation is more complex but offers greater fidelity for features like complex caves.

### C. Technical Considerations:
-   **Computational Cost:** Simulations are expensive; often run once at world creation.
-   **Modularity:** Design systems as interchangeable modules.
-   **Parameterization:** Allow configuration of generation steps.
-   **Debugging/Visualization:** Essential for inspecting intermediate stages.
