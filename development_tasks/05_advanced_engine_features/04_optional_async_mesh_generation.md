# Optional Task: Implement Advanced Asynchronous Mesh Generation

**High-Level Goal:** Offload mesh generation to background threads to prevent stalling the main game loop, improving overall performance and responsiveness, especially with many dynamic chunk updates.

**Parent Task:** [5. Advanced Engine Features & Game Systems (C++)](/home/system-x1/Projects/Voxel Castle/CURRENT_TODO.md#5-advanced-engine-features--game-systems-c)

**Initial Consideration Reference:**
*   This task expands on the initial consideration noted in sub-task 5.2 of `/home/system-x1/Projects/Voxel Castle/development_tasks/02_core_systems/03_build_mesh_generation_system.md`.

## Sub-Tasks (To be detailed if this task becomes a priority):

### 1. Design Asynchronous Mesh Generation Architecture
    - [ ] 1.1. Finalize threading model (e.g., thread pool size, dedicated threads).
    - [ ] 1.2. Define task queue mechanism (e.g., for `ChunkSegment`s needing mesh rebuilds).
    - [ ] 1.3. Define results queue/callback mechanism for completed meshes.
    - [ ] 1.4. Specify data ownership and transfer strategy for voxel data (to workers) and mesh data (to main thread).
    - [ ] 1.5. Detail synchronization primitives and strategies (mutexes, condition variables, atomics).
    - [ ] 1.6. Design error handling and cancellation mechanisms.
    - [ ] 1.7. Plan integration with `WorldManager` and `ChunkSegment`.

### 2. Implement Thread Management
    - [ ] 2.1. Implement thread pool or worker thread creation and management.
    - [ ] 2.2. Implement task submission and retrieval logic for the queue.

### 3. Implement Mesh Generation Worker Logic
    - [ ] 3.1. Adapt existing `MeshBuilder` (or create a new version) to run on worker threads.
    - [ ] 3.2. Ensure thread-safe access to voxel data (e.g., by copying necessary data or using read-only access with proper lifetime management).

### 4. Implement Main Thread Integration
    - [ ] 4.1. Implement logic on the main thread to retrieve completed mesh data.
    - [ ] 4.2. Handle GPU resource creation (VBOs, EBOs) for new/updated meshes on the main thread.
    - [ ] 4.3. Ensure proper synchronization when swapping in new meshes.

### 5. Testing and Profiling
    - [ ] 5.1. Test with various scenarios (e.g., rapid chunk changes, large world loading).
    - [ ] 5.2. Profile to ensure the asynchronous system effectively reduces main thread stalls.
    - [ ] 5.3. Debug and resolve any concurrency issues (race conditions, deadlocks).

**Notes & Considerations:**
*   This is a significant undertaking and should only be prioritized if profiling (from task 5.3 of mesh generation) indicates that synchronous mesh generation is a major performance bottleneck.
*   Careful attention to thread safety and synchronization is paramount.
*   Consider using C++ standard library features for threading (`std::thread`, `std::mutex`, `std::condition_variable`, `std::future`, `std::async`) or a well-tested threading library.
