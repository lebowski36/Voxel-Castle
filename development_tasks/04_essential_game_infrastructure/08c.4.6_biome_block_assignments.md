# Biome System Implementation: Block Assignment and Placement

*Created: 2025-06-08 17:42*  
*Status: ACTIVE - IMPLEMENTATION PLANNING*

## Overview

This task involves defining and implementing the block assignments for each biome type, along with the placement algorithms that determine how these blocks are distributed within biomes. This will leverage our 257-block palette to create visually distinctive and realistic biome environments.

## Task Details

### 1. Block Assignment Definition

- [ ] Create a comprehensive biome-to-block mapping document:
  - Define primary blocks for each biome (surface, subsurface, deep)
  - Specify vegetation blocks for each biome
  - Define special feature blocks for each biome
  - Identify transition blocks for biome boundaries

- [ ] Create a file `data/biome_block_assignments.json` to store these mappings:
  ```json
  {
    "version": "1.0",
    "biomes": [
      {
        "name": "PLAINS",
        "blocks": {
          "surface": "GRASS_BLOCK",
          "subsurface": "DIRT_BLOCK",
          "deep": "STONE_BLOCK",
          "vegetation": ["TALL_GRASS", "FLOWER_RED", "FLOWER_YELLOW"],
          "features": ["OAK_TREE_SMALL", "BOULDER_SMALL"],
          "rare_features": ["PLAINS_RUINS"]
        },
        "block_distribution": {
          "vegetation_density": 0.7,
          "feature_density": 0.05,
          "rare_feature_density": 0.005
        }
      },
      // ... other biomes
    ]
  }
  ```

### 2. Identify Missing Blocks

- [ ] Analyze block requirements for all biomes
- [ ] Compare with available blocks in the 257-block palette
- [ ] Create a list of new blocks needed for full biome implementation:

  | Biome | Missing Block | Purpose | Texture Needs |
  |-------|---------------|---------|---------------|
  | Forest | PINE_LEAVES | Conifer foliage | Green needle texture |
  | Desert | SAND_RED | Red desert | Reddish sand texture |
  | Mountains | SNOW_BLOCK | Mountain peaks | White snow texture |
  | ... | ... | ... | ... |

### 3. Create New Block Definitions

- [ ] For each missing block, create the appropriate JSON definition in `data/blocks/`:
  ```json
  {
    "id": "PINE_LEAVES",
    "display_name": "Pine Leaves",
    "category": "NATURAL",
    "properties": {
      "solid": true,
      "transparent": true,
      "destructible": true,
      "natural": true,
      "flammable": true
    },
    "texture_pattern": "ALL_FACES_SAME",
    "textures": {
      "all": "pine_leaves"
    }
  }
  ```

- [ ] Create or source textures for new blocks
- [ ] Generate block code and textures using the unified workflow

### 4. Block Distribution Implementation

- [ ] Create `engine/include/world/biome/biome_block_placer.h` and cpp file
- [ ] Implement BiomeBlockPlacer class:
  ```cpp
  class BiomeBlockPlacer {
  public:
      BiomeBlockPlacer(const BiomeRegistry& registry);
      
      // Core block placement methods
      BlockType getBlockType(BiomeType biome, int worldX, int worldY, int worldZ, 
                            float localNoise, float temperatureFactor, float humidityFactor);
      
      // Vegetation placement
      bool shouldPlaceVegetation(BiomeType biome, int worldX, int worldY, int worldZ);
      BlockType getVegetationBlockType(BiomeType biome, int worldX, int worldZ);
      
      // Feature placement
      bool shouldPlaceFeature(BiomeType biome, int worldX, int worldZ);
      void generateFeature(ChunkSegment& segment, BiomeType biome, 
                          int worldX, int worldY, int worldZ);
      
  private:
      const BiomeRegistry& biomeRegistry_;
      std::mt19937_64 rng_;
      
      // Block selection helpers
      BlockType getSurfaceBlock(BiomeType biome, int worldX, int worldY, int worldZ);
      BlockType getSubsurfaceBlock(BiomeType biome, int worldX, int worldY, int worldZ);
      BlockType getDeepBlock(BiomeType biome, int worldX, int worldY, int worldZ);
      
      // Special case handlers
      BlockType getTransitionBlock(BiomeType primary, BiomeType secondary, 
                                  int worldX, int worldY, int worldZ);
  };
  ```

### 5. Integration with ChunkBiomeProcessor

- [ ] Connect BiomeBlockPlacer to ChunkBiomeProcessor
- [ ] Implement efficient block lookup and placement
- [ ] Create transition handling for biome boundaries

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Block Definition**: First define all blocks needed for each biome
2. **Create Missing Blocks**: Add any required blocks to the block system
3. **Basic Placement Logic**: Implement basic block placement rules
4. **Advanced Distribution**: Add noise-based variation and probabilities
5. **Transition Handling**: Implement smooth transitions between biomes

## Visual Testing Plan

1. **Block Palette Test**:
   - Create test worlds with each biome type
   - Verify appropriate block selection for all elevations
   - Check transition areas between biomes

2. **Distribution Test**:
   - Verify vegetation density matches biome settings
   - Check feature placement frequency and appropriateness
   - Test variation within biomes for natural appearance

3. **Visual Quality Assessment**:
   - Evaluate overall appearance of each biome
   - Compare transitions between biomes for smoothness
   - Check for any visual artifacts or unnatural patterns

## Success Criteria

- Each biome has a distinct and recognizable appearance
- Block distribution creates realistic-looking environments
- Transitions between biomes are smooth and natural
- All blocks are properly textured and rendered
- Performance remains acceptable with full biome detail

## Dependencies

- [08c.4.2_biome_core_types_implementation.md](/home/system-x1/Projects/Voxel Castle/development_tasks/04_essential_game_infrastructure/08c.4.2_biome_core_types_implementation.md) - Core biome types
- Comprehensive Block System (completed)

## Next Steps After Completion

1. Refine block distribution based on visual testing
2. Add more variation within biomes
3. Create specialized unique features for each biome
