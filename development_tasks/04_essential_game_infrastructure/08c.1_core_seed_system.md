## Overview
This document details the core seed system that will power Voxel Castle's two-tier world generation. The seed system provides deterministic, reproducible world generation for both world-scale pre-generation and runtime chunk voxelization.

**STATUS**: ✅ **CORE IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED** (commit 3cdcdc1)
- WorldSeed class with enhanced functionality
- Feature-specific seed domains
- Scale-aware noise generation
- Comprehensive test suite
- Enhanced noise system integration

## Design Goals

1. ✅ **Determinism**: Same seed always produces identical worlds at all scales
2. ✅ **Two-Tier Support**: Separate seed domains for world creation vs. runtime generation
3. ✅ **Flexibility**: Support both numeric and string-based seeds
4. ✅ **Localized Variation**: Generate different terrain in different areas
5. ✅ **Extensibility**: Support massive worlds and future features
6. ✅ **Performance**: Fast seed-to-value conversion for real-time generation

## Seed Architecture for Two-Tier Generation

### Master World Seed
- **Purpose**: Single source of truth for entire world
- **Scope**: Controls all aspects of world generation
- **Format**: 64-bit integer derived from user input (numeric or string)

### Regional Seed Domain (Tier 1 - Pre-Generation)
- **Purpose**: Generate consistent seeds for 1km² regions
- **Usage**: Climate patterns, biome placement, civilization sites
- **Persistence**: Stored in world template database
- **Performance**: Generated once during world creation

### Chunk Seed Domain (Tier 2 - Runtime)
- **Purpose**: Generate consistent seeds for 32x32x32 voxel chunks
- **Usage**: Detailed terrain, structure placement, ore veins
- **Determinism**: Must reproduce identical results from world template + chunk coordinates
- **Performance**: Generated in <1ms for real-time play

## Core Components

### WorldSeed Class

**Purpose**: Central management of the world seed and derived values

**Key Functionality**:
- [x] ✅ Store and manage the master world seed (64-bit)
- [x] ✅ Convert string seeds to numeric values (hash-based)
- [x] ✅ Generate consistent random values for any world coordinate
- [x] ✅ Support separate seed domains for different scales and features
- [x] ✅ Thread-safe access for parallel generation

### RegionalSeed Generator (Tier 1)

**Purpose**: Generate consistent seeds for world-scale regions

**Key Functionality**:
- [ ] Region-level seed generation (`getRegionSeed(regionX, regionZ)`)
- [ ] Climate seed generation (`getClimateSeed(regionX, regionZ)`)
- [ ] Biome placement seeds (`getBiomeSeed(regionX, regionZ)`)
- [ ] Civilization seeds (`getCivilizationSeed(regionX, regionZ)`)
- [ ] Historical event seeds (`getHistorySeed(regionX, regionZ, year)`)

### ChunkSeed Generator (Tier 2)

**Purpose**: Generate consistent, unique seeds for runtime chunk generation

**Key Functionality**:
- [x] ✅ Chunk-level seed generation (`getChunkSeed(chunkX, chunkY, chunkZ)`)
- [x] ✅ Block-level seed generation (`getBlockSeed(x, y, z)`)
- [x] ✅ Feature-specific seed generation (`getFeatureSeed(x, y, z, featureType)`)
- [x] ✅ Structure placement seeds (`getStructureSeed(chunkX, chunkZ)`)
- [x] ✅ Cave network seeds (`getCaveSeed(chunkX, chunkY, chunkZ)`)

### Scalable World Support

**Coordinate System**:
- **Region Coordinates**: 1km² regions for world template data
- **Chunk Coordinates**: 32x32x32 voxel chunks for runtime generation
- **Block Coordinates**: Individual voxel positions

**Large World Considerations**:
- **32-bit Chunk Coordinates**: Support worlds up to 25,000,000km²
- **Coordinate Wrapping**: Handle coordinate overflow gracefully
- **Regional Streaming**: Load region data from disk as needed

### Noise Generation Integration

**Purpose**: Connect seed system to procedural noise generators

**Key Functionality**:
- [x] ✅ Seed-based initialization of noise generators
- [x] ✅ Multiple noise layers with different parameters
- [x] ✅ Domain warping for natural-looking terrain
- [x] ✅ Octave noise with seed-based parameters

## Implementation Details

### Seed Initialization

1. **User-Provided Seed**:
   - Numeric: Use directly as the master seed
   - String: Hash the string to produce a numeric seed
   - Empty/Random: Generate a random seed value

2. **Seed Transformation**:
   - Apply seed scrambling to avoid patterns with sequential seeds
   - Use prime number multiplication to improve distribution
   - Store the transformed seed as the master seed

### Coordinate-Based Seed Derivation

For generating unique seed values at each location:

```
// Pseudocode (not actual implementation)
uint64_t getBlockSeed(int64_t x, int64_t y, int64_t z) {
    // Combine position with master seed
    // Use bit operations and prime multiplication to distribute values
    // Return a unique but deterministic value for this position
}
```

### Feature-Specific Seeds

Different world features will use different "seed domains" to ensure independent randomization:

```
// Pseudocode (not actual implementation)
uint64_t getFeatureSeed(int64_t x, int64_t y, int64_t z, FeatureType type) {
    // Combine position with master seed and feature type
    // Each feature type gets a different random sequence
}
```

## Transition Strategy

### Phase 1: Basic Seed Implementation
- [x] ✅ Create WorldSeed class with basic functionality
- [x] ✅ Implement coordinate-based seed derivation
- [x] ✅ Connect seed system to existing noise generators
- [x] ✅ Support numeric, string, and random seeds
- [x] ✅ Validate reproducibility with test worlds

### Phase 2: Extended Functionality
- [x] ✅ Add feature-specific seed domains
- [ ] Implement region and chunk level seed generation
- [ ] Add biome seed generation  
- [ ] Support structure placement seeding

### Phase 3: Integration
- [ ] Connect to world creation dialog
- [ ] Store seed in level.dat
- [ ] Add seed display in debug overlay

## Technical Notes

### Seed Uniqueness

To ensure different seeds produce significantly different worlds:
- Use high-quality bit mixing algorithms
- Apply avalanche effect principles
- Test with sequential seeds to confirm variation

### Performance Considerations

Seed derivation must be fast since it's used during chunk generation:
- Use bit operations rather than division/modulo
- Cache common values
- Minimize heap allocations

## Testing Strategy

1. **Reproducibility Testing**: Generate same world twice with same seed
2. **Variation Testing**: Verify different seeds produce different worlds
3. **Edge Case Testing**: Test boundary values, very large/small seeds
4. **Performance Testing**: Measure generation time with seed system

- [ ] **Coordinate Seed Viewer**: Display derived seed values at cursor position
- [ ] **Visualization Overlay**: Toggle to show seed-derived values as colored heat map
- [ ] **Comparison Mode**: Generate small preview areas with different seeds for comparison

### Testing UI Elements

- [ ] **Seed Evolution Slider**: Visualize how small changes to seeds affect generation
- [ ] **Multi-View Display**: Split-screen view of the same location with different seeds
