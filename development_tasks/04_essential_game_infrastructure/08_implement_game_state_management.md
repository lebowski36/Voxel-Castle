# Game State Management Implementation

## Overview
Implement a comprehensive Game State Management system for the voxel fortress colony simulation that handles game modes, pause/resume, save/load functionality, and state transitions. This system will coordinate between first-person avatar control, strategic overseer mode, menu states, and handle persistence for the complex colony simulation.

## Context Analysis
Based on project documentation review, this voxel fortress colony simulation has several unique requirements:

### Core Game Modes Identified
1. **First-Person Avatar Control**: Direct control of a colonist with physics-based movement
2. **Strategic Overseer Mode**: Free-camera colony management and planning
3. **Menu/Pause State**: Current basic implementation via ESC key
4. **Hybrid Mode**: Seamless switching between control modes during gameplay

### Colony Simulation Context
- **Complex World State**: Voxel world with colonist AI, resource systems, production chains
- **Persistent Simulation**: Colony continues running when not paused
- **Save/Load Requirements**: Full world state, colonist data, progress, settings
- **Multiple Control Contexts**: Different UI needs for each control mode

## Current State Analysis
### Existing Implementation
- ✅ Basic `GameState` enum (PLAYING, MENU) in `game.h`
- ✅ Menu system with pause/resume functionality
- ✅ Camera mode switching (FREE_FLYING, FIRST_PERSON)
- ✅ Mouse capture management for different states
- ✅ UI visibility management (HUD, crosshair, menus)

### Missing Components
- ❌ Save/Load game state system
- ❌ Game mode state machine beyond basic pause
- ❌ Colony simulation pause/resume coordination
- ❌ Time control system (pause, speed adjustment)
- ❌ State persistence and configuration management
- ❌ Transition management between control modes
- ❌ World state serialization

## Requirements

### Core State Management
1. **Enhanced Game State Machine**: Expand beyond PLAYING/MENU to include mode-specific states
2. **Time Control System**: Pause, resume, and time scaling for the colony simulation
3. **Save/Load System**: Complete game state persistence with versioning
4. **Mode Transition Management**: Smooth switching between control modes
5. **Settings Persistence**: Save user preferences and game configuration

### Colony Simulation Integration
1. **Simulation Coordination**: Proper pause/resume of AI systems, resource production
2. **State Serialization**: World data, colonist states, resource stockpiles, progress
3. **Auto-save System**: Periodic saves with configurable intervals
4. **Quick Save/Load**: Instant save and reload functionality

### Control Mode Integration
1. **Mode-Specific State**: Camera positions, UI configurations per mode
2. **Context Retention**: Remember selections and state when switching modes
3. **Input State Management**: Different input handling per game mode

## Notes
This implementation builds upon the existing basic state management and will significantly enhance the game's functionality to support the complex colony simulation requirements. The system should be designed to be extensible for future features like multiplayer state synchronization and mod support.
