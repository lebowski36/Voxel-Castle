## Overview
This document outlines the structure generation system for Voxel Castle. The structure system will handle the generation of buildings, landmarks, dungeons, and other pre-designed features within the world.

## Design Goals

1. **Variety**: Diverse collection of generated structures
2. **Contextual Placement**: Structures that fit their environment
3. **Deterministic Generation**: Consistent placement based on world seed
4. **Performance**: Efficient generation without significant performance impact
5. **Modularity**: Easy addition of new structure types

## Core Components

### StructureType Enumeration

**Purpose**: Define all available structure types

**Initial Structure Types**:
- [ ] **Village**: Collection of buildings forming a settlement
- [ ] **Dungeon**: Underground rooms with challenges and rewards
- [ ] **Temple**: Special above-ground structures with unique architecture
- [ ] **Mine**: Abandoned underground tunnels
- [ ] **Tower**: Vertical landmark structures
- [ ] **Ruin**: Partially destroyed ancient structures

### StructureGenerator Class

**Purpose**: Control placement and generation of structures

**Key Functionality**:
- [ ] Seed-based structure placement
- [ ] Biome compatibility checking
- [ ] Structure density control
- [ ] Placement validation (terrain compatibility)
- [ ] Structure rotation and variation

### StructureTemplate System

**Purpose**: Define the blueprint for individual structures

**Key Functionality**:
- [ ] Block-by-block structure definition
- [ ] Variation points and randomization
- [ ] Special block placement (chests, spawners, etc.)
- [ ] Connection points for multi-part structures

## Implementation Details

### Structure Placement Algorithm

The process for determining structure placement:

1. **Region Division**: Divide world into large regions
2. **Candidate Selection**: Use seed to select potential structure locations
3. **Validation**: Check terrain compatibility at candidate locations
4. **Density Control**: Ensure appropriate spacing between structures
5. **Final Placement**: Set final position, orientation, and variation

### Structure Generation Process

When generating a structure:

1. **Template Selection**: Choose appropriate template for location
2. **Variation Application**: Apply seed-based variations to template
3. **Terrain Adaptation**: Adjust structure to fit terrain
4. **Block Placement**: Place structure blocks into the world
5. **Special Feature Addition**: Add chests, monsters, etc.

## Technical Approach

### Structure Placement Logic

```
// Pseudocode (not actual implementation)
bool shouldPlaceStructure(StructureType type, int32_t chunkX, int32_t chunkZ, uint64_t seed) {
    // Use seed to deterministically decide if structure should be placed
    // Check biome compatibility
    // Verify minimum distance from other structures
    // Return true if structure should be placed at this location
}
```

### Structure Generation Logic

```
// Pseudocode (not actual implementation)
void generateStructure(StructureType type, ChunkColumn* chunk, uint64_t seed) {
    // Select appropriate template
    // Apply variations based on seed
    // Adapt to terrain
    // Place structure blocks
    // Add special features
}
```

## Structure Types Detail

### Villages
- Collection of buildings (houses, shops, farms)
- Connected by paths
- NPC inhabitants
- Different architectural styles based on biome

### Dungeons
- Underground rooms with corridors
- Contain treasures and challenges
- Monster spawners
- Multiple levels possible

### Temples
- Larger, more complex structures
- Unique architecture
- Special rewards/challenges
- Themed to surrounding biome

### Mines
- Underground tunnel networks
- Abandoned equipment and carts
- Ore deposits
- Potential hazards

## Transition Strategy

## Technical Notes

### Performance Considerations
- Only generate structures in chunks being loaded
- Use efficient validation algorithms
- Consider structure caching

### Structure Validation
- Check for terrain compatibility before placement
- Prevent structure overlap
- Ensure accessibility of entrances

## Testing Strategy

1. **Visual Inspection**: Check structure appearance and placement
2. **Seed Testing**: Verify consistent placement with same seed
3. **Performance Testing**: Measure impact on generation speed
4. **Compatibility Testing**: Test structures in all biome types

## Visual Testing & Feedback System

### Structure Visualization Tools

To ensure structure generation works correctly and provide immediate feedback during development:

#### Structure Placement Overlay
- [ ] **Structure Location Map**: Overlay showing where structures will/have been placed
- [ ] **Placement Validation Indicators**: Visual markers showing valid vs invalid placement locations
- [ ] **Structure Type Icons**: Different icons/colors for different structure types on the map
- [ ] **Density Heatmap**: Visualization of structure density across different areas

#### Interactive Structure Tools
- [ ] **Structure Spawner**: Debug tool to manually place structures for testing
- [ ] **Structure Inspector**: Click on structures to see generation details (type, seed, parameters)
- [ ] **Placement Rule Tester**: Visual feedback showing why structures can/cannot be placed at specific locations
- [ ] **Structure Preview**: Show structure outline before final placement

### Development Testing Interface

#### Placement Algorithm Testing
- [ ] **Placement Parameter Sliders**: Adjust structure frequency, spacing, and rules in real-time
- [ ] **Rule Violation Highlighter**: Visual indicators when placement rules are violated
- [ ] **Distance Checker**: Visual radius showing minimum distance requirements between structures
- [ ] **Biome Compatibility Display**: Show which structures are valid for the current biome

#### Structure Template Testing
- [ ] **Template Viewer**: 3D preview of structure templates before placement
- [ ] **Template Editor Interface**: In-game tool to modify and test structure templates
- [ ] **Variation Preview**: Show different variations of the same structure type
- [ ] **Scale and Rotation Tester**: Test different structure sizes and orientations
