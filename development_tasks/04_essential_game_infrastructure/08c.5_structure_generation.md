## Overview
This document outlines the two-tier structure generation system for Voxel Castle. The structure system handles placement of buildings, landmarks, dungeons, and historical features across all world sizes from 10km² to 25,000,000km².

## Design Goals

1. **Two-Tier Architecture**: Regional structure placement + detailed chunk implementation
2. **Historical Integration**: Structures reflect simulated world history and civilizations
3. **Scalable Variety**: Structure density and types adapt to world size
4. **Contextual Placement**: Structures that fit their environment and historical context
5. **Deterministic Generation**: Consistent placement based on world seed
6. **Performance**: Efficient generation for massive worlds

## Two-Tier Structure Architecture

- **Performance**: Generate entire world's structure plan during creation phase

### Tier 2: Detailed Structure Implementation (Runtime)
- **Scope**: Generate actual structure voxels when chunks are loaded
- **Data**: Detailed block placement, interior layouts, treasure placement
- **Source**: Regional structure plan + deterministic generation algorithms
- **Performance**: Real-time structure generation during chunk loading

## Implementation Details

### Structure Placement Algorithm

The process for determining structure placement:

1. **Region Division**: Divide world into large regions
2. **Candidate Selection**: Use seed to select potential structure locations
3. **Validation**: Check terrain compatibility at candidate locations
4. **Density Control**: Ensure appropriate spacing between structures
5. **Final Placement**: Set final position, orientation, and variation

### Structure Generation Process

When generating a structure:

1. **Template Selection**: Choose appropriate template for location
2. **Variation Application**: Apply seed-based variations to template
3. **Terrain Adaptation**: Adjust structure to fit terrain
4. **Block Placement**: Place structure blocks into the world
5. **Special Feature Addition**: Add chests, monsters, etc.

## Technical Approach

### Structure Placement Logic

```
// Pseudocode (not actual implementation)
bool shouldPlaceStructure(StructureType type, int32_t chunkX, int32_t chunkZ, uint64_t seed) {
    // Use seed to deterministically decide if structure should be placed
    // Check biome compatibility
    // Verify minimum distance from other structures
    // Return true if structure should be placed at this location
}
```

### Structure Generation Logic

```
// Pseudocode (not actual implementation)
void generateStructure(StructureType type, ChunkColumn* chunk, uint64_t seed) {
    // Select appropriate template
    // Apply variations based on seed
    // Adapt to terrain
    // Place structure blocks
    // Add special features
}
```
