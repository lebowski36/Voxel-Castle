## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of cave generation systems for the 08c two-tier world generation architecture. Cave systems provide underground exploration, resource access, and complex three-dimensional terrain features that scale from small worlds to massive quarter-Earth-size worlds.

## Two-Tier Cave Architecture

### Tier 1: Regional Cave Planning (Pre-Generation)
- **Scope**: Plan cave networks for 1km² regions during world creation
- **Data**: Cave system types, major chamber locations, geological context
- **Geological Integration**: Consider regional rock types, water tables, tectonic history
- **Performance**: Plan entire world's cave systems during creation phase

### Tier 2: Detailed Cave Implementation (Runtime)
- **Scope**: Generate actual cave voxels when chunks are loaded
- **Data**: Precise tunnel routes, chamber shapes, feature placement
- **Source**: Regional cave plan + deterministic algorithms
- **Performance**: Real-time cave generation during chunk loading

## Design Requirements (from Design Document)

### Underground Generation Features
- **Cave Systems**: Networks of interconnected caverns of varying sizes
- **Layer Stratification**: Different rock and mineral layers at appropriate depths
- **Special Features**: Crystal caverns, lava chambers, underground lakes
- **Chasms & Ravines**: Deep vertical cuts through the terrain
- **Ancient Structures**: Ruins, dungeons, or other points of interest underground

### Geological Accuracy
- **Realistic Formation**: Caves follow geological principles (water erosion, limestone karst, lava tubes)
- **Depth Stratification**: Different cave types at different depths
- **Structural Integrity**: Caves maintain realistic support and don't create impossible overhangs
- **Water Table Integration**: Caves interact properly with groundwater systems

## Scalable Cave Implementation

### Small Worlds (10km²-100km²)
- **Cave Density**: Moderate, hand-crafted feeling networks
- **Detail Level**: Rich cave features, unique chambers, detailed formations
- **Geological Complexity**: Simple but realistic geological layers

### Regional Worlds (1,000km²-10,000km²)  
- **Cave Density**: Varied based on regional geology and biomes
- **Detail Level**: Mix of detailed showcase caves and simpler networks
- **Geological Complexity**: Regional geological variation affects cave types

### Continental/Massive Worlds (100,000km²+)
- **Cave Density**: Realistic Earth-like distribution based on geology
- **Detail Level**: Procedural variation to avoid repetition across vast areas
- **Geological Complexity**: Full geological simulation drives cave formation

### Phase 3: Integration with Surface Features
**Goal**: Connect caves to surface world and other systems

#### 3.1 Cave Entrances
- **Natural Entrances**: Sinkholes, cliff faces, valley openings
- **Hidden Entrances**: Concealed behind vegetation or rocks
- **Multiple Entrances**: Large cave systems with several access points
- **Entrance Types**: Walk-in, climb-down, squeeze-through

#### 3.2 Surface-Cave Interaction
- **Spring Sources**: Underground rivers emerging as surface springs
- **Sinkhole Formation**: Surface collapse into underlying caves
- **Chimney Formations**: Vertical shafts connecting levels
- **Cave-influenced Terrain**: Surface features indicating caves below

#### 3.3 Integration with Other Systems
- **Water Table**: Caves below water table are flooded
- **Ore Generation**: Special mineral deposits in certain cave types
- **Biome Integration**: Cave environments vary by surface biome
- **Structure Placement**: Ancient ruins may extend into caves

## Technical Implementation

### Cave Generation Algorithm
```cpp

    void generateCaves(ChunkSegment& chunk, const WorldSeed& seed, 
                      int worldX, int worldY, int worldZ);
    
    // Check if a voxel should be carved out for caves
    bool shouldCarveCave(int globalX, int globalY, int globalZ, 
                        const WorldSeed& seed);
    
    // Generate cave features (formations, water, etc.)
    void generateCaveFeatures(ChunkSegment& chunk, const WorldSeed& seed);
    
private:
    // 3D noise for cave placement
    EnhancedNoise caveNoise_;
    
    // Different noise layers for different cave types
    EnhancedNoise karst_noise_;     // Limestone caves
    EnhancedNoise lava_noise_;      // Lava tubes
    EnhancedNoise fracture_noise_;  // Fault caves
