# Task: Implement Block Placement System

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

## Overview
Implement interactive block placement and removal system with real-time mesh updates, block selection, and UI feedback. This system allows players to modify the voxel world through mouse interactions and see immediate visual feedback.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Block Interaction System ✅ COMPLETE
**Goal:** Implement basic block placement and removal with mouse controls.

- [x] **1.1: Mouse Ray Casting**
  - ✅ Implement screen-to-world ray casting from camera position
  - ✅ Calculate ray direction from mouse position (center of screen)
  - ✅ Add ray-voxel intersection testing to find target block/face
  - ✅ Return both the block being pointed at and the adjacent face for placement

- [x] **1.2: Block Placement Logic**
  - ✅ Implement left mouse button handler for block placement
  - ✅ Place new block adjacent to the face being pointed at
  - ✅ Ensure placement doesn't overlap with player position
  - ✅ Validate placement position is within world bounds

- [x] **1.3: Block Removal Logic**
  - ✅ Implement right mouse button handler for block removal
  - ✅ Remove block that mouse is pointing at (replace with AIR)
  - ✅ Ensure removal doesn't break world structure (if applicable)
  - ✅ Handle edge cases (trying to remove AIR blocks)

### Phase 2: Block Selection & UI System ✅ COMPLETE
**Goal:** Add block type selection and visual feedback.

- [x] **2.1: Block Type Management** ✅ COMPLETE
  - ✅ Create block type enumeration/list (exclude AIR from selectable types)
  - ✅ Implement current block type tracking in game state
  - ✅ Add mouse wheel scroll handler for cycling through block types
  - ✅ Initialize with reasonable default block type (e.g., STONE)

- [x] **2.2: Block Selection UI** ✅ COMPLETE
  - ✅ Block selection UI element created (BlockSelectionUI class)
  - ✅ UI element positioned at bottom center of screen
  - ✅ Basic code for displaying block texture from atlas
  - ✅ UI element visibility issues resolved
  - ✅ Error logging and rendering pipeline working correctly
  - ✅ OpenGL state management functioning properly

- [x] **2.3: Visual Feedback** ✅ COMPLETE
  - [x] Add block outline/highlight for block being pointed at ✅ COMPLETE (Face highlighting implemented)
  - [x] Show placement preview (where new block will be placed) ✅ COMPLETE (Textured block preview implemented)
  - ~~Add visual confirmation when blocks are placed/removed~~ (NOT NEEDED - preview and visual changes sufficient)
  - ~~Consider adding sound effects for placement/removal actions~~ (NOT NEEDED)

### Phase 3: Dynamic Mesh Updates ✅ COMPLETE (CRITICAL BUG RESOLVED)
**Goal:** ~~Resolve critical bug causing window disappearance upon block modification.~~ Update mesh generation system to handle real-time world changes.now 

**RESOLVED ISSUES:**
- ✅ **FIXED**: Critical window disappearance bug has been resolved through fixes to:
  - Excessive MeshRenderer logging spam that was overwhelming console output
  - Excessive WorldManager logging spam from mesh job enqueueing
  - Critical VAO corruption bug in GameRenderer that was causing OpenGL state corruption
  - Game now runs stably for 2,675+ frames with successful block placement (9 blocks placed successfully)

**CURRENT STATUS:**
- ✅ Block placement/removal works correctly and triggers mesh updates
- ✅ Game runs stably without crashes during block operations
- ✅ Mesh regeneration system functions properly with multithreaded processing
- ✅ Block placement validation prevents placement in occupied positions (working as intended)
- ⚠️ Minor OpenGL error (GL_INVALID_ENUM 0x500) appears but doesn't cause crashes
- ✅ Temporary single-mesh rendering fix prevents VAO corruption (full multi-mesh rendering needs architectural improvements)

- [x] **3.1: Chunk Modification Tracking** ✅ COMPLETE
  - ✅ `markChunkDirtyForPosition` correctly called for both placement and removal
  - ✅ Mesh regeneration happens correctly after marking dirty
  - ✅ Cross-chunk boundary updates handled properly

- [x] **3.2: Real-time Mesh Regeneration** ✅ COMPLETE
  - ✅ Integration with `MeshJobSystem` working correctly
  - ✅ Mesh updates don't conflict with rendering thread
  - ✅ Mesh updates happen without blocking game loop
  - ✅ Visual updates happen immediately after block changes

- [x] **3.3: Memory Management** ✅ COMPLETE
  - ✅ Efficient storage for chunk modifications implemented
  - ✅ Dirty/clean state tracking works correctly
  - ✅ Data structures optimized for fast lookup and modification

### Phase 4: Advanced Features & Polish ⏳ PENDING
**Goal:** Add sophisticated features and optimize the system.

- [x] **4.1: Collision Detection** ✅ COMPLETE
  - [x] Fix face selection for hidden/internal faces (only allow selection of visible faces) ✅ COMPLETE
  - [x] Implement placement validation (can't place blocks inside player) ✅ COMPLETE
  - ~~Add support for different block properties (solid vs. non-solid)~~ (NOT NEEDED FOR NOW)
  - ~~Handle special placement rules for different block types~~ (NOT NEEDED FOR NOW)
  - ~~Add undo/redo functionality for block operations~~ (NOT NEEDED)

- ~~**4.2: Performance Optimization**~~ (NOT NEEDED)
  - ~~Optimize ray casting for better performance~~
  - ~~Batch mesh updates when multiple blocks change rapidly~~
  - ~~Implement LOD considerations for distant chunks~~
  - ~~Profile and optimize bottlenecks in the placement system~~

- [x] **4.3: Enhanced User Experience** ✅ COMPLETE
  - [x] Add crosshair/targeting reticle in center of screen ✅ COMPLETE
    - [x] Integrate with existing HUD/UI system (follow same visibility rules as BlockSelectionUI) ✅ COMPLETE
    - [x] Crosshair should disappear when menus are open (same logic as block selection UI) ✅ COMPLETE
    - [x] Implement as simple center-screen crosshair graphic (+ symbol) ✅ COMPLETE
    - [x] Position crosshair at exact screen center for precise aiming feedback ✅ COMPLETE
    - [x] Ensure crosshair renders above world but below menu UI (proper z-order) ✅ COMPLETE
    - [x] Use consistent UI rendering pipeline with other HUD elements ✅ COMPLETE
  - ~~Implement distance limits for block placement/removal~~ (NOT NEEDED)
  - ~~Add keyboard shortcuts for common block types~~ (NOT NEEDED)
  - ~~Consider adding creative mode vs. survival mode logic~~ (NOT NEEDED FOR NOW)

## Technical Considerations

### Integration Points
- **Input System**: Extend existing mouse and keyboard handlers
- **Rendering System**: Add UI rendering for block selection display
- **World Manager**: Extend with block modification capabilities
- **Mesh Generation**: Modify to support incremental updates
- **Camera System**: Use for ray casting calculations

### Dependencies
- Requires functional camera system (✅ Complete)
- Requires mesh generation system (✅ Complete)
- Requires input handling system (✅ Complete)
- May require UI framework extension

### Testing Strategy
- Test placement/removal in various world locations
- Verify mesh updates happen correctly and efficiently
- Test edge cases (world boundaries, player collision)
- Performance testing with rapid block modifications
- UI responsiveness and visual feedback testing
