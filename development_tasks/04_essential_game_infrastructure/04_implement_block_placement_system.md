# Task: Implement Block Placement System

## Status: üîÑ IN PROGRESS

## Overview
Implement interactive block placement and removal system with real-time mesh updates, block selection, and UI feedback. This system allows players to modify the voxel world through mouse interactions and see immediate visual feedback.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Block Interaction System ‚úÖ COMPLETE
**Goal:** Implement basic block placement and removal with mouse controls.

- [x] **1.1: Mouse Ray Casting**
  - ‚úÖ Implement screen-to-world ray casting from camera position
  - ‚úÖ Calculate ray direction from mouse position (center of screen)
  - ‚úÖ Add ray-voxel intersection testing to find target block/face
  - ‚úÖ Return both the block being pointed at and the adjacent face for placement

- [x] **1.2: Block Placement Logic**
  - ‚úÖ Implement left mouse button handler for block placement
  - ‚úÖ Place new block adjacent to the face being pointed at
  - ‚úÖ Ensure placement doesn't overlap with player position
  - ‚úÖ Validate placement position is within world bounds

- [x] **1.3: Block Removal Logic**
  - ‚úÖ Implement right mouse button handler for block removal
  - ‚úÖ Remove block that mouse is pointing at (replace with AIR)
  - ‚úÖ Ensure removal doesn't break world structure (if applicable)
  - ‚úÖ Handle edge cases (trying to remove AIR blocks)

### Phase 2: Block Selection & UI System ‚úÖ COMPLETE
**Goal:** Add block type selection and visual feedback.

- [x] **2.1: Block Type Management**
  - ‚úÖ Create block type enumeration/list (exclude AIR from selectable types)
  - ‚úÖ Implement current block type tracking in game state
  - ‚úÖ Add mouse wheel scroll handler for cycling through block types
  - ‚úÖ Initialize with reasonable default block type (e.g., STONE)

- [ ] **2.2: Block Selection UI**
  - Implement small square UI element at bottom center of screen
  - Display texture of currently selected block type
  - Ensure UI element scales properly with screen resolution
  - Add proper UI rendering in the game loop

- [ ] **2.3: Visual Feedback**
  - Add block outline/highlight for block being pointed at
  - Show placement preview (where new block will be placed)
  - Add visual confirmation when blocks are placed/removed
  - Consider adding sound effects for placement/removal actions

### Phase 3: Dynamic Mesh Updates ‚è≥ IN PROGRESS
**Goal:** Update mesh generation system to handle real-time world changes.

**CRITICAL ISSUE DISCOVERED: Window crash on mouse click when captured**
- ‚ùå **BLOCKING BUG**: When mouse is captured (Escape pressed), any mouse click causes immediate window close/crash
- ‚ùå **Missing mesh regeneration**: Block removal doesn't trigger mesh updates (missing markChunkDirtyForPosition call)
- ‚ùå **Potential threading issues**: Mesh updates may not be thread-safe with game loop
- ‚ùå **Namespace inconsistencies**: Mixed VoxelCastle/VoxelEngine namespaces could cause runtime issues

**IMMEDIATE FIXES NEEDED:**
1. Fix block removal to include mesh regeneration call
2. Investigate crash cause in handleMouseClick method (likely exception/memory issue)
3. Verify thread safety of world modification during rendering
4. Test basic block placement/removal functionality once crash is resolved

- [ ] **3.1: Chunk Modification Tracking**
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially implemented: markChunkDirtyForPosition exists but missing for removal
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Need to verify that mesh regeneration actually happens after marking dirty
  - Handle cross-chunk boundary updates (blocks affecting adjacent chunks)

- [ ] **3.2: Real-time Mesh Regeneration**
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Integration with MeshJobSystem needs verification
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Ensure mesh updates don't conflict with rendering thread
  - Handle mesh updates without blocking game loop
  - Ensure visual updates happen immediately after block changes

- [ ] **3.3: Memory Management**
  - Implement efficient storage for chunk modifications
  - Track dirty/clean state of chunks
  - Consider memory limits and cleanup strategies
  - Optimize data structures for fast lookup and modification

### Phase 4: Advanced Features & Polish ‚è≥ PENDING
**Goal:** Add sophisticated features and optimize the system.

- [ ] **4.1: Advanced Placement Rules**
  - Implement placement validation (can't place blocks inside player)
  - Add support for different block properties (solid vs. non-solid)
  - Handle special placement rules for different block types
  - Add undo/redo functionality for block operations

- [ ] **4.2: Performance Optimization**
  - Optimize ray casting for better performance
  - Batch mesh updates when multiple blocks change rapidly
  - Implement LOD considerations for distant chunks
  - Profile and optimize bottlenecks in the placement system

- [ ] **4.3: Enhanced User Experience**
  - Add crosshair/targeting reticle in center of screen
  - Implement distance limits for block placement/removal
  - Add keyboard shortcuts for common block types
  - Consider adding creative mode vs. survival mode logic

## Technical Considerations

### Integration Points
- **Input System**: Extend existing mouse and keyboard handlers
- **Rendering System**: Add UI rendering for block selection display
- **World Manager**: Extend with block modification capabilities
- **Mesh Generation**: Modify to support incremental updates
- **Camera System**: Use for ray casting calculations

### Dependencies
- Requires functional camera system (‚úÖ Complete)
- Requires mesh generation system (‚úÖ Complete)
- Requires input handling system (‚úÖ Complete)
- May require UI framework extension

### Testing Strategy
- Test placement/removal in various world locations
- Verify mesh updates happen correctly and efficiently
- Test edge cases (world boundaries, player collision)
- Performance testing with rapid block modifications
- UI responsiveness and visual feedback testing
