# 08d.2: Fix Current Atlas Generation Issues  
*Created: 2025-06-06 23:45*
*Last Updated: 2025-06-06 23:45*
*Priority: HIGH - Blocking 08d.1 implementation*

## Status: SUPERSEDED BY 08d.1 🔄
*Decision: Implement new face-based atlas system instead of fixing current single-atlas issues*

## Strategic Decision ✅

After analysis, we've decided to **skip the current bug fixes** and **jump directly to implementing the new efficient face-based atlas system (08d.1)**. 

### Rationale:
1. **Architectural Change**: 08d.1 fundamentally changes atlas organization (multiple efficient atlases vs single large atlas)
2. **Avoid Wasted Work**: Fixing the current system would mean throwing away that work when implementing the new design
3. **Better Foundation**: Starting fresh with the new system will be cleaner and more maintainable
4. **Same Core Components**: The modular texture generators will be reused - we're just changing atlas organization

### What Carries Forward:
- ✅ Modular texture generators (stone_textures.py, wood_textures.py, etc.)
- ✅ Base patterns and color palettes
- ✅ 32x32 tile quality and detail level
- ✅ Block taxonomy and classification

### What Changes:
- 🔄 Atlas organization: Multiple efficient atlases instead of one 1024x1024 atlas
- 🔄 Face classification: Formal system for multi-face blocks
- 🔄 Packing logic: Smart allocation based on actual block needs

**Next Action**: Proceed with 08d.1 implementation
