# 08d.2: Fix Current Atlas Generation Issues  
*Created: 2025-06-06 23:45*
*Last Updated: 2025-06-08 17:30*
*Priority: HIGH - Blocking 08d.1 implementation*

## Status: OFFICIALLY COMPLETED ✅
*Decision: All essential bugfixes completed and user confirmed completion*

## Task History

### Initial Strategic Decision (2025-06-06) ✅
Initially, we decided to **skip the current bug fixes** and **jump directly to implementing the new efficient face-based atlas system (08d.1)**. This was a sensible architectural decision that allowed us to make faster progress.

### Subsequent Bugfix Work (2025-06-07) ✅
After implementing the efficient face-based atlas system, we returned to fix critical texture generation issues to ensure all worldgen-relevant blocks render correctly:

1. **Fixed ore textures** - Resolved mapping issues that were causing ores (coal, iron, copper, gold, etc.) to appear with black veins instead of appropriately colored ones
2. **Enhanced gem/crystal textures** - Improved the visual distinction between ruby, sapphire, emerald, and diamond
3. **Fixed texture mapper function signatures** - Aligned function parameter expectations for smooth operation  

### Key Improvements:
- ✅ Ore textures now have proper colored veins matching their mineral type
- ✅ Gem textures are visually distinct and have appropriate coloring
- ✅ Function signature consistency across texture generators
- ✅ Block mappings properly connect to appropriate texture generators

### Carried Forward Elements:
- ✅ Modular texture generators (stone_textures.py, wood_textures.py, etc.)
- ✅ Base patterns and color palettes
- ✅ 32x32 tile quality and detail level
- ✅ Block taxonomy and classification

### Continuing Development:
- 🔄 Block visualization UI proposed for comprehensive testing (future task)
- 🔄 Complete coverage of all worldgen-relevant blocks (addressed in 08d.3)

**Next Action**: Continue with 08d.3 (Worldgen Block Coverage Analysis)
