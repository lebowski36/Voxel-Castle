## Success Criteria

- The selected database format should support all functional requirements
- Read access should be fast enough not to impact gameplay (< 16ms per access)
- Storage requirements should be reasonable (< 1GB for 1,000km² world)
- The format should be easily extensible for future features
- Implementation should integrate cleanly with existing architecture

## Dependencies

## Analysis: Is SQLite the Best Approach?

*Analysis Date: 2025-06-08 21:00*

**TL;DR: SQLite is NOT the best choice for our use case. Custom chunked binary format or HDF5 would be better.**

### Why SQLite Might NOT Be Optimal

**1. Our Data Access Patterns Don't Match SQL Strengths:**
- Our data is primarily **spatial/geographic** (2D grid of regions)
- We need **fast streaming access** for chunks of adjacent regions
- We rarely need complex queries or joins
- Most access is simple: "Get region data at coordinates (x, y)"

**2. Performance Concerns:**
- SQL query overhead for simple spatial lookups
- SQLite's row-based storage isn't optimal for tightly packed environmental data
- B-tree indexes add overhead for simple 2D coordinate lookups

**3. Data Structure Mismatch:**
- Our data is naturally **hierarchical** (Region → Climate → Biome → Geology)
- Environmental data is better represented as structured binary data
- SQL tables would force artificial normalization

**4. Streaming Performance:**
- SQLite loads entire database pages, not necessarily adjacent regions
- For world traversal, we need efficient spatial locality
- Large worlds would create huge SQLite files with poor cache behavior

### Better Alternatives

**RECOMMENDED: Custom Chunked Binary Format + Spatial Index**

**Structure:**
```
world_name/
├── metadata.json           # World info, generation params
├── spatial_index.bin      # Fast 2D coordinate → file mapping
└── regions/
    ├── region_0000_0000.bin    # Binary region data
    ├── region_0000_0001.bin
    └── ...
```

**Benefits:**
- **Perfect spatial locality**: Adjacent regions = adjacent files
- **Streaming friendly**: Only load regions as needed
- **Cache efficient**: OS file caching works optimally
- **Simple implementation**: Direct binary serialization
- **Extensible**: Easy to version and add fields
- **Platform native**: No external dependencies

**ALTERNATIVE: HDF5 (For Complex Scientific Data)**

If we implement complex geological/climate simulation:
- Designed for scientific datasets (exactly our use case)
- Excellent compression
- Hierarchical data organization
- Cross-platform, but adds dependency

### Implementation Recommendation

**Phase 1: Simple Binary Chunks** (Current needs)
```cpp
struct RegionalData {
    uint32_t version;
    BiomeType primaryBiome;
    float temperature;
    float humidity;
    float elevation;
    // ... other environmental data
};
```

**Phase 2: Compressed Hierarchical** (Advanced features)
- When we add climate/geological simulation
- Consider HDF5 or custom compression
- Maintain streaming performance

### Decision Rationale

Our requirements are:
- ✅ **Fast 2D spatial access** → Binary chunks excel
- ✅ **Streaming for large worlds** → File-per-region perfect
- ✅ **Simple integration** → Direct C++ struct serialization
- ✅ **No dependencies** → Custom format wins
- ❌ **Complex queries** → We don't need this
- ❌ **Relational data** → Our data is spatial, not relational

**SQLite is a hammer, but our problem isn't a nail.**

## Next Steps

Based on the analysis, we will proceed with **Custom Chunked Binary Format** implementation:

### 1. Immediate Implementation (Phase 1.2)
- [ ] **Define RegionalData C++ structure** with future-ready fields
- [ ] **Implement binary serialization/deserialization** for regional data
- [ ] **Create spatial file organization** (`world_name/regions/region_x_y.bin`)
- [ ] **Build spatial index system** for fast coordinate → file mapping
- [ ] **Test with basic biome data** to validate approach

### 2. Integration Steps
- [ ] **Modify world generation** to output regional data files
- [ ] **Update chunk generation** to read from regional database
- [ ] **Implement streaming system** for large world traversal
- [ ] **Add compression support** (future optimization)

### 3. Validation Criteria
- ✅ **Read performance**: < 1ms for regional data access
- ✅ **Streaming efficiency**: Smooth world traversal without stutters
- ✅ **Storage efficiency**: Reasonable file sizes for world data
- ✅ **Extensibility**: Easy to add new environmental data fields

**Decision Status: APPROVED - Custom Binary Format**
**Implementation Priority: HIGH - Required for Phase 1.2 completion**
