## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of realistic ore and resource distribution systems for the 08c two-tier world generation architecture. This system ensures geological accuracy while providing meaningful resource management challenges across world sizes from 10km² to 25,000,000km².

## Two-Tier Resource Architecture

### Tier 1: Regional Resource Planning (Pre-Generation)
- **Scope**: Plan major resource deposits for 1km² regions during world creation
- **Data**: Geological formations, major ore bodies, resource abundance levels
- **Geological Integration**: Consider regional geology, tectonic history, climate effects
- **Performance**: Plan entire world's resource distribution during creation phase

### Tier 2: Detailed Resource Implementation (Runtime)
- **Scope**: Generate precise ore veins and resource placement when chunks are loaded
- **Data**: Exact ore block placement, vein structures, local variations
- **Source**: Regional resource plan + deterministic algorithms
- **Performance**: Real-time resource generation during chunk loading

## Design Requirements (from Design Document)

### Mineral Distribution Features
- **Ore Veins**: Metal deposits following geological principles
- **Gem Clusters**: Rare valuable resources in specific geological contexts

    float veinWidth = getVeinWidth(ore);
    float richness = getVeinRichness(ore);
    
    for (float distance = 0; distance < length; distance += 0.5f) {
        // Follow direction with some random variation
        currentX += direction.x + randomVariation();
        currentY += direction.y + randomVariation();
        currentZ += direction.z + randomVariation();
        
        // Place ore in voxels around the vein centerline
        placeOreInRadius(chunk, glm::ivec3(currentX, currentY, currentZ),
