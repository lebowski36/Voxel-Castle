## Overview
This document outlines the requirements and implementation plan to ensure the new seed-based world generation system achieves feature parity with the legacy system. This is a critical step before fully transitioning away from the legacy generation.

## Design Goals

1. **Functional Equivalence**: Reproduce all current generation features
2. **Visual Consistency**: Similar terrain aesthetics and style
3. **Performance Parity**: Equal or better generation speed
4. **Seamless Transition**: Players should not notice negative differences
5. **Improved Architecture**: Better code organization while maintaining features

## Legacy System Analysis

### Current Features to Preserve

#### Terrain Generation
- [ ] Overall height distribution and variation
- [ ] Mountain and hill formation
- [ ] Valley and depression formation
- [ ] Water body placement and level
- [ ] Beach/shore transitions

#### Block Distribution
- [ ] Surface block selection (grass, sand, etc.)
- [ ] Sub-surface layers (dirt, stone, etc.)
- [ ] Ore distribution patterns
- [ ] Special block placement (clay, gravel patches)

#### World Features
- [ ] Tree placement and types
- [ ] Grass and flower distribution
- [ ] Water features (lakes, rivers if present)
- [ ] Any existing structures or landmarks

#### Technical Features
- [ ] Loading/unloading chunk behavior
- [ ] Performance characteristics
- [ ] Memory usage patterns

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Documentation and Analysis
- [ ] Document the exact behavior of the legacy system
- [ ] Create visual references (screenshots, height maps)
- [ ] Measure performance characteristics
- [ ] Identify any bugs or limitations to fix

### Phase 2: Core Terrain Reproduction
- [ ] Implement base terrain generation algorithm
- [ ] Tune noise parameters to match legacy feel
- [ ] Validate height distribution matches legacy system
- [ ] Ensure water level and placement match

### Phase 3: Block Layer Reproduction
- [ ] Implement surface block selection logic
- [ ] Match sub-surface layer distribution
- [ ] Reproduce ore placement patterns
- [ ] Add special feature blocks

### Phase 4: Feature Placement
- [ ] Implement tree placement algorithm
- [ ] Match plant distribution
- [ ] Reproduce any existing structures
- [ ] Add water features in correct locations

### Phase 5: Testing and Tuning
- [ ] Side-by-side visual comparison
- [ ] Performance benchmarking
- [ ] User testing for "feel" and consistency
- [ ] Final parameter tuning

## Technical Approach

### Noise Parameter Matching

To achieve similar terrain:
- [ ] Analyze noise frequency and amplitude in legacy system
- [ ] Identify octave count and persistence values
- [ ] Recreate equivalent noise configuration in new system
- [ ] Fine-tune until visual match is achieved

### Block Selection Logic

For correct block placement:
- [ ] Document legacy block selection rules
- [ ] Implement equivalent rules in new system
- [ ] Match thresholds for transitions
- [ ] Validate with test worlds

### Feature Placement

For vegetation and structures:
- [ ] Document legacy feature placement algorithm
- [ ] Analyze density and distribution patterns
- [ ] Implement seed-based placement with similar patterns
- [ ] Match frequency and grouping behavior

## Validation Methodology

### Objective Metrics
- [ ] Height distribution histograms
- [ ] Block type frequency analysis
- [ ] Feature density measurements
- [ ] Generation time comparisons

### Visual Verification
- [ ] Same-seed side-by-side comparisons
- [ ] Distance view aesthetics
- [ ] Local detail inspection
- [ ] Time-of-day appearance

## Technical Notes

### Legacy Code Reuse

When appropriate:
- Consider adapting algorithms from legacy system
- Refactor for improved architecture while preserving behavior
- Preserve magic numbers/constants that affect generation

### Performance Considerations

While maintaining parity:
- Look for optimization opportunities
- Consider parallelization where appropriate
- Measure and compare memory usage

## Testing Strategy

1. **Direct Comparison**: Generate worlds with both systems using same seed
2. **Statistical Analysis**: Compare block distributions and height maps
3. **Performance Testing**: Compare generation speed and resource usage
4. **User Testing**: Gather feedback on feel and appearance

## Next Steps

1. Document legacy generation algorithms in detail
2. Create test worlds with legacy system for reference
3. Begin implementing core terrain generation
4. Create visual comparison tools
5. Iteratively tune parameters to match legacy system
