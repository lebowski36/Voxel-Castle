## Overview
This document outlines the requirements and implementation plan to ensure the new seed-based world generation system achieves feature parity with the legacy system. This is a critical step before fully transitioning away from the legacy generation.

## Design Goals

1. **Functional Equivalence**: Reproduce all current generation features
2. **Visual Consistency**: Similar terrain aesthetics and style
3. **Performance Parity**: Equal or better generation speed
4. **Seamless Transition**: Players should not notice negative differences
5. **Improved Architecture**: Better code organization while maintaining features

## Legacy System Analysis

### Current Features to Preserve

#### Terrain Generation
- [ ] Overall height distribution and variation
- [ ] Mountain and hill formation
- [ ] Valley and depression formation
- [ ] Water body placement and level
- [ ] Beach/shore transitions

#### Block Distribution
- [ ] Surface block selection (grass, sand, etc.)
- [ ] Sub-surface layers (dirt, stone, etc.)
- [ ] Ore distribution patterns
- [ ] Special block placement (clay, gravel patches)

#### World Features
- [ ] Tree placement and types
- [ ] Grass and flower distribution
- [ ] Water features (lakes, rivers if present)
- [ ] Any existing structures or landmarks

#### Technical Features
- [ ] Loading/unloading chunk behavior
- [ ] Performance characteristics
- [ ] Memory usage patterns

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Documentation and Analysis
- [ ] Document the exact behavior of the legacy system
- [ ] Create visual references (screenshots, height maps)
- [ ] Measure performance characteristics
- [ ] Identify any bugs or limitations to fix

### Phase 2: Core Terrain Reproduction
- [ ] Implement base terrain generation algorithm
- [ ] Tune noise parameters to match legacy feel
- [ ] Validate height distribution matches legacy system
- [ ] Ensure water level and placement match

### Phase 3: Block Layer Reproduction
- [ ] Implement surface block selection logic
- [ ] Match sub-surface layer distribution
- [ ] Reproduce ore placement patterns
- [ ] Add special feature blocks

### Phase 4: Feature Placement
- [ ] Implement tree placement algorithm
- [ ] Match plant distribution
- [ ] Reproduce any existing structures
- [ ] Add water features in correct locations

### Phase 5: Testing and Tuning
- [ ] Side-by-side visual comparison
- [ ] Performance benchmarking
- [ ] User testing for "feel" and consistency
- [ ] Final parameter tuning

## Technical Approach

### Noise Parameter Matching

To achieve similar terrain:
- [ ] Analyze noise frequency and amplitude in legacy system
- [ ] Identify octave count and persistence values
- [ ] Recreate equivalent noise configuration in new system
- [ ] Fine-tune until visual match is achieved

### Block Selection Logic

For correct block placement:
- [ ] Document legacy block selection rules
- [ ] Implement equivalent rules in new system
- [ ] Match thresholds for transitions
- [ ] Validate with test worlds

### Feature Placement

For vegetation and structures:
- [ ] Document legacy feature placement algorithm
- [ ] Analyze density and distribution patterns
- [ ] Implement seed-based placement with similar patterns
- [ ] Match frequency and grouping behavior

## Validation Methodology

### Objective Metrics
- [ ] Height distribution histograms
- [ ] Block type frequency analysis
- [ ] Feature density measurements
- [ ] Generation time comparisons

### Visual Verification
- [ ] Same-seed side-by-side comparisons
- [ ] Distance view aesthetics
- [ ] Local detail inspection
- [ ] Time-of-day appearance

## Technical Notes

### Legacy Code Reuse

When appropriate:
- Consider adapting algorithms from legacy system
- Refactor for improved architecture while preserving behavior
- Preserve magic numbers/constants that affect generation

### Performance Considerations

While maintaining parity:
- Look for optimization opportunities
- Consider parallelization where appropriate
- Measure and compare memory usage

## Visual Testing & Feedback System

### Side-by-Side Comparison Tools

To ensure feature parity is achieved and measurable, we need comprehensive visual testing tools:

#### Real-Time Comparison Interface
- [ ] **Split-Screen View**: Display legacy and new generation side-by-side for the same seed
- [ ] **Overlay Comparison**: Toggle between legacy and new generation for the same area
- [ ] **Difference Visualization**: Highlight differences between systems using color coding
- [ ] **Synchronized Navigation**: Move camera in both views simultaneously for easy comparison

#### Statistical Comparison Dashboard
- [ ] **Block Distribution Charts**: Real-time graphs showing block type frequencies for both systems
- [ ] **Height Map Comparison**: Visual height difference maps between legacy and new systems
- [ ] **Terrain Feature Analysis**: Count and compare terrain features (hills, valleys, etc.)
- [ ] **Percentage Match Display**: Show overall similarity percentage between systems

### Interactive Testing Tools

#### Legacy System Analysis
- [ ] **Legacy World Inspector**: Tool to analyze and document existing legacy world characteristics
- [ ] **Parameter Extraction**: Reverse-engineer legacy parameters from existing worlds
- [ ] **Feature Cataloging**: Visual catalog of all terrain features the legacy system produces
- [ ] **Seed Analysis Tool**: Analyze how legacy system responds to different seeds

#### New System Calibration
- [ ] **Parameter Tuning Interface**: Adjust new system parameters while viewing real-time comparison
- [ ] **Feature Matching Tool**: Specific tools to match individual terrain features (mountains, plains, etc.)
- [ ] **Quality Metrics Dashboard**: Real-time display of how close new system matches legacy
- [ ] **Convergence Indicator**: Visual indicator showing progress toward feature parity

### Development Workflow Integration

#### Iterative Testing Process
- [ ] **Quick Test Worlds**: Generate small test worlds for rapid iteration
- [ ] **Automated Comparison**: Batch compare multiple test worlds and generate reports
- [ ] **Regression Detection**: Alert when changes move away from parity
- [ ] **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress indicators for each terrain feature's parity status

#### Visual Documentation
- [ ] **Before/After Screenshots**: Automated capture of comparison views for documentation
