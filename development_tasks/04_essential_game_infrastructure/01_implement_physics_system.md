## Design Decisions & Implementation Details

### Confirmed Design Choices
**Movement Features:**
- ‚úÖ **Sprint Mode**: Shift key enables faster movement (~8-10 m/s vs normal 4-5 m/s)
- ‚úÖ **Crouch Mode**: Ctrl key allows crouching (reduces height to ~0.9m, slower movement)
- ‚úÖ **Fall Damage**: Implement damage when landing from high falls
- üö´ **Sound Effects**: Deferred to separate audio system (not part of physics)

**Movement Feel:**
- ‚úÖ **Arcade-style**: Instant response to input for responsive controls
- No momentum/acceleration - immediate velocity changes like current camera

**Collision Detection:**
- ‚úÖ **Simple Box Collision**: Each solid voxel = box collider (fastest to implement)
- Ray-based detection for ground detection and step-up checks
- Focus on performance and simplicity for initial implementation

### Player Specifications

## Implementation Notes

### Existing Infrastructure
- **ECS System**: Flecs ECS already in place with PositionComponent, VelocityComponent
- **Movement System**: Basic MovementSystem exists but needs physics integration
- **Voxel World**: WorldManager provides voxel data access for collision detection
- **Component Architecture**: Clean component system ready for physics components

### Integration Points
- **Game Loop**: Physics system needs integration with main update loop
- **Rendering**: Physics state must synchronize with rendering positions
- **Input**: Player input should drive physics forces rather than direct velocity
- **World**: Physics must respond to dynamic voxel world changes

### Testing Strategy
- **Entity Spawning**: Create test entities to verify physics behavior
- **Movement Testing**: Test player physics with various input combinations
- **Collision Testing**: Verify collision detection with different voxel configurations
- **Performance Testing**: Monitor physics impact on frame rate and memory
