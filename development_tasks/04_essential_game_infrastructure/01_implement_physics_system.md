## Implementation Notes

### Existing Infrastructure
- **ECS System**: Flecs ECS already in place with PositionComponent, VelocityComponent
- **Movement System**: Basic MovementSystem exists but needs physics integration
- **Voxel World**: WorldManager provides voxel data access for collision detection
- **Component Architecture**: Clean component system ready for physics components

### Integration Points
- **Game Loop**: Physics system needs integration with main update loop
- **Rendering**: Physics state must synchronize with rendering positions
- **Input**: Player input should drive physics forces rather than direct velocity
- **World**: Physics must respond to dynamic voxel world changes

### Testing Strategy
- **Entity Spawning**: Create test entities to verify physics behavior
- **Movement Testing**: Test player physics with various input combinations
- **Collision Testing**: Verify collision detection with different voxel configurations
- **Performance Testing**: Monitor physics impact on frame rate and memory
