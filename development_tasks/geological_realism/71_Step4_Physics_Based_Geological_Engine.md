# Step 4: Physics-Based Geological Engine
*Created: 2025-06-11*
*Status: ACTIVE - Ready to implement*

## üéØ **Goal: Replace Exponential Growth with Realistic Geological Physics**

**NOTE: This step is superseded by Step 4.1 (Simulation Architecture Overhaul) which addresses the fundamental sequential vs interleaved process architecture. See [71a_Step4.1_Simulation_Architecture_Overhaul.md](71a_Step4.1_Simulation_Architecture_Overhaul.md) for the new implementation approach.**

Implement proper geological physics including isostatic equilibrium, erosion-uplift balance, and steady-state force systems to create stable, realistic terrain evolution instead of the current terrain flattening problem.

**Visual Feedback**: Continental drift, realistic mountain building, terrain that reaches natural equilibrium
**Testability**: Watch continents move and collide, mountains grow and settle realistically within bounds
**Foundation**: Stable, bounded geological simulation that maintains realistic elevation ranges

## üö® **Critical Problem This Solves**

The current simulation **flattens over time** because:
- **No isostatic equilibrium**: Heavy mountains don't sink back down
- **No erosion-uplift balance**: Erosion overwhelms mountain building
- **Accumulating forces**: Stress accumulates without natural limits
- **Missing feedback loops**: No self-regulating geological systems

**Physics-based engine will provide:**
- **Isostatic equilibrium**: Heavy mountains sink, light areas rise
- **Force balance**: Tectonic forces reach natural equilibrium
- **Erosion-uplift balance**: Erosion rates balance mountain building
- **Stable elevation ranges**: Natural bounds emerge from physics

## üîß **Scale Integration Requirements**

- **Geological Resolution**: 4096√ó4096 simulation samples with realistic physics
- **Time Scales**: Proper geological time scaling for realistic process rates
- **Force Balance**: All geological forces must reach equilibrium states
- **Elevation Stability**: Terrain should stabilize within realistic bounds (-1800m to +1200m)
