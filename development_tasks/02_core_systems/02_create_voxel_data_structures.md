# Task: Create Voxel Data Structures

**Date Created:** 2025-05-12
**Status:** Not Started
**Depends On:** ECS Implementation
**Leads To:** Mesh Generation System

## 1. Overview
This task focuses on designing and implementing the core data structures for storing and managing voxel data within the Voxel Castle engine. Efficient voxel data structures are critical for performance, especially concerning world generation, rendering, physics, and game logic.

## 2. Goals
*   Define a clear and efficient representation for individual voxels.
*   Design a chunk-based system for managing large voxel worlds.
*   Implement basic chunk management (creation, storage, retrieval).
*   Consider future needs like voxel types, lighting data, and metadata.

## 3. Sub-Tasks

### 3.1. Define Voxel Structure
*   **Status:** TODO
*   **Description:** Define the data structure for a single voxel.
    *   [ ] **3.1.1.** Determine the information each voxel needs to store (e.g., type ID, active state, potentially lighting, health, etc.).
    *   [ ] **3.1.2.** Create `Voxel.h` (e.g., in `engine/include/world/voxel.h` or similar).
    *   [ ] **3.1.3.** Implement the `Voxel` struct/class. Keep it lightweight.
        *   Example: `struct Voxel { uint8_t type_id; /* other data */ };`

### 3.2. Design Chunk Structure
*   **Status:** TODO
*   **Description:** Design the data structure for a chunk of voxels.
    *   [ ] **3.2.1.** Define chunk dimensions (e.g., 16x16x16 or 32x32x32 voxels).
    *   [ ] **3.2.2.** Decide on the storage mechanism for voxels within a chunk (e.g., 3D array `Voxel voxels[WIDTH][HEIGHT][DEPTH];`).
    *   [ ] **3.2.3.** Create `Chunk.h` (e.g., in `engine/include/world/chunk.h`).
    *   [ ] **3.2.4.** Implement the `Chunk` class/struct.
        *   Include methods for getting/setting voxels at local coordinates.
        *   Consider methods for converting local to world coordinates and vice-versa (or handle this in a `World` manager).
        *   Store chunk position/coordinates.

### 3.3. Implement Chunk Storage/Management (Initial)
*   **Status:** TODO
*   **Description:** Implement a basic system for managing chunks.
    *   [ ] **3.3.1.** Design a `World` or `ChunkManager` class (e.g., `engine/include/world/world.h` and `engine/src/world/world.cpp`).
    *   [ ] **3.3.2.** Implement a simple storage mechanism for active chunks (e.g., `std::unordered_map<ChunkCoord, std::unique_ptr<Chunk>>`).
    *   [ ] **3.3.3.** Implement methods to load/generate a new chunk at given coordinates.
        *   For now, this can just allocate a new `Chunk` object, perhaps filled with air or a solid material.
    *   [ ] **3.3.4.** Implement methods to get a chunk by its coordinates.
    *   [ ] **3.3.5.** Implement methods to get/set a voxel at world coordinates (delegating to the appropriate chunk).

### 3.4. Initial Voxel Types
*   **Status:** TODO
*   **Description:** Define a few basic voxel types.
    *   [ ] **3.4.1.** Create an enum or constants for basic voxel types (e.g., `AIR`, `STONE`, `DIRT`, `GRASS`) in a suitable header (e.g., `engine/include/world/voxel_types.h`).

### 3.5. Integration and Testing (Basic)
*   **Status:** TODO
*   **Description:** Perform basic tests of the voxel and chunk structures.
    *   [ ] **3.5.1.** In `main.cpp` or a test file, create a `World` manager instance.
    *   [ ] **3.5.2.** Request a few chunks to be generated.
    *   [ ] **3.5.3.** Set and get some voxel types within these chunks using world coordinates.
    *   [ ] **3.5.4.** Print or log the results to verify correctness.

### 3.6. Documentation
*   **Status:** TODO
*   **Description:** Document the voxel and chunk data structures.
    *   [ ] **3.6.1.** Add a section to `docs/design_specifications/Tech Stack/Voxel Data Structures Details.md` (create if it doesn't exist) describing the `Voxel` and `Chunk` structures, their rationale, and how they are managed.

## 4. Considerations
*   **Memory Layout:** Optimize for cache coherency. A flat array for voxels within a chunk is generally good.
*   **Chunk Size:** Balance between too many small chunks (overhead) and too few large chunks (granularity issues for loading/meshing). 16x16x16 or 32x32x32 are common.
*   **Coordinate Systems:** Clearly define local (chunk) vs. world coordinates and how conversions are handled.
*   **Extensibility:** Design with future needs in mind (e.g., storing more data per voxel, different chunk states).
*   **Performance:** Voxel access (get/set) should be as fast as possible.

## 5. Decisions to be Made
*   Exact data to be stored per voxel initially.
*   Chunk dimensions.
*   Initial set of voxel types.
