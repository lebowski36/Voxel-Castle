# Sub-Task: Debug Voxel Mesh Texture Rendering

**Parent Task:** `03_build_mesh_generation_system.md`
**Date:** May 13, 2025
**Status:** In Progress

## 1. Goal
Successfully render the main voxel mesh with textures sampled from `assets/textures/atlas.png`. The mesh is currently rendering with UVs visualized as color (mostly red), indicating an issue with texture coordinates or their application.

## 2. Current State & Observations
- Main voxel mesh UVs are visualized using `FragColor = vec4(vTexCoord.x, vTexCoord.y, 0.0, 1.0);` in `voxel.frag`.
- The mesh appears predominantly red, suggesting `vTexCoord.x` is high (near 1.0) and/or `vTexCoord.y` is low (near 0.0) for the visible faces.
- A debug quad displaying the *entire* `assets/textures/atlas.png` in the top-left corner renders correctly.
- Camera position has been adjusted for a better view of the voxel mesh.
- `MeshRenderer::draw` was cleaned up regarding `glUseProgram` and `uTextureSampler` uniform setting.

## 3. Debugging Plan & Steps

### Step 3.1: Render a Single Tile (STONE) from Atlas to a Debug Quad
- **Status:** âœ… COMPLETED
- **Action:** Modify `game/src/main.cpp` to render a new quad (e.g., 128x128px) in a corner of the screen. This quad should display *only* the STONE tile (Tile ID 1, typically at atlas coordinates x=1, y=0) sampled from `assets/textures/atlas.png`.
- **Verification:** The debug quad correctly displays the STONE texture.
- **Findings:**
    - The main texture atlas (`atlas.png`) is loaded correctly by the `Texture` class.
    - The `debug_atlas_display` shader (or a similar simple texturing shader) can correctly sample and display a specific tile from the atlas when provided with accurate UV coordinates.
    - UVs for STONE tile (1,0) are: `(1/16, 0/16)` to `(2/16, 1/16)`. Adjusted for bottom-left origin in UVs for `main.cpp` debug quad: U `[1/16, 2/16]`, V `[15/16, 16/16]`.
    - This confirms the texture loading and basic sampling mechanism is functional. The issue likely lies in the UV generation or application for the main voxel mesh.

### Step 3.2: Analyze Voxel Mesh UV Generation
- **Status:** âœ… COMPLETED (Analysis and Correction Applied)
- **Action:**
    - Review `MeshBuilder::addQuad` and `MeshBuilder::addFace` (and its callers/helpers like `TextureAtlas::getTextureCoordinates`) in `engine/src/rendering/mesh_builder.cpp` and `engine/include/rendering/texture_atlas.h`.
    - Verify that the `tileX` and `tileY` (or equivalent logic) passed to `TextureAtlas::getTextureCoordinates` are correct for the voxel types being rendered.
    - Confirm the UV order returned by `TextureAtlas::getTextureCoordinates` matches the vertex order defined in `MeshBuilder::addQuad` and `MeshBuilder::addFace`.
- **Findings:**
    - The `TextureAtlas` class in `engine/include/rendering/texture_atlas.h` was not correctly inverting the V-coordinate for UVs. It assumed a bottom-left origin for the atlas image's V-coordinate, while textures (like PNGs loaded by `stb_image` by default) typically have a top-left origin. OpenGL UVs expect a bottom-left origin.
    - This resulted in low `vTexCoord.y` values (near 0.0) for tiles in the upper rows of the atlas image, causing the UV visualization to appear "mostly red".
    - A correction has been applied to `TextureAtlas` to calculate V-coordinates as `v_gl = 1.0f - v_atlas_image_row_normalized`.
    - The logic in `MeshBuilder::addFace` correctly uses these `TextureCoordinates` and applies them to vertices in the standard order (BL, BR, TR, TL), which matches the vertex definitions for faces.
    - With the corrected `TextureAtlas`, the `vTexCoord.y` values for common tiles (Stone, Dirt, Grass) should now be high (near 1.0).

### Step 3.2.1. Verify Corrected UVs on Main Voxel Mesh
- **Status:** âœ… COMPLETED
- **Action:** Rebuild and run the game with `assets/shaders/voxel.frag` still outputting `FragColor = vec4(vTexCoord.x, vTexCoord.y, 0.0, 1.0);`.
- **Expected Result:** The main voxel mesh should now appear predominantly greenish or yellowish-green, reflecting the corrected (higher) `vTexCoord.y` values for common surface tiles. It should *not* be mostly red.
- **Actual Result:** Confirmed via screenshot. The main voxel mesh rendered as bright green, indicating `vTexCoord.y` is high (near 1.0) and `vTexCoord.x` is low (near 0.0). This is consistent with the V-coordinate correction for tiles in the upper rows and early columns of the atlas.

### Step 3.3: Restore Texture Sampling in `voxel.frag`
- **Status:** ðŸŸ¡ PENDING
- **Action:** Change `assets/shaders/voxel.frag` back to `FragColor = texture(uTextureSampler, vTexCoord);`. Ensure alpha discard `if(FragColor.a < 0.1) discard;` is active.
- **Expected Result:** The main voxel mesh should render with actual textures sampled from the atlas.

### Step 3.4: Iterative Debugging & OpenGL State Checks
- **Objective:** If texturing still fails, systematically check other potential OpenGL-related issues.
- **Actions:**
    - Double-check texture unit activation (`glActiveTexture(GL_TEXTURE0)`) and texture binding (`glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, textureAtlasID)`) in `MeshRenderer::draw` immediately before the draw call for the voxel mesh.
    - Verify `glUniform1i(texSamplerLoc, 0);` is correctly setting the sampler to texture unit 0.
    - Thoroughly check for any OpenGL errors using `glGetError()` at various stages.
    - Ensure the correct shader program (`shaderProgram` in `MeshRenderer`) is bound when drawing the voxel mesh.
    - Consider if any other OpenGL state (depth testing, culling, etc.) could interfere, though blending is already enabled.
- **Status:** âšª NOT STARTED

## 4. Overall Findings Log
- *(May 13, 2025)* Initial observation: Voxel mesh UV visualization is mostly red. Full atlas debug quad works. Camera centered.
- *(May 13, 2025)* Single stone tile debug quad (top-right) renders correctly, confirming atlas loading and basic tile sampling with correct UVs is possible. Problem likely in main mesh UV generation/application.
- *(May 13, 2025)* TextureAtlas V-coordinate inversion corrected. UV visualization for main voxel mesh expected to improve.
- *(To be updated as steps are completed)*
