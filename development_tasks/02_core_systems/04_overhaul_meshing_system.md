# 04 - Overhaul Meshing System

## Overview
Complete overhaul of the current meshing system to address missing mesh rendering issues and create a modular, maintainable architecture that supports multiple meshing algorithms and future LOD implementation.

## Current Issues
- Some meshes that should be rendered are missing/not drawn
- Monolithic meshing code lacks modularity
- Cannot easily switch between different meshing approaches
- GL_INVALID_ENUM (0x500) errors during buffer uploads (secondary concern)

## Objectives
1. **Modular Architecture**: Separate meshing logic into individual, reusable files
2. **Algorithm Flexibility**: Support multiple meshing algorithms with easy switching mechanism
3. **LOD Readiness**: Design with future Level of Detail system in mind
4. **Fix Missing Meshes**: Resolve core rendering issues with current approach

## Sub-Tasks

### 4.1 Investigate Current Meshing System
- [ ] Analyze existing mesh generation pipeline
- [ ] Identify bottlenecks and missing mesh causes
- [ ] Document current greedy meshing implementation

### 4.2 Design Modular Architecture
- [ ] Create base meshing interface/abstract class
- [ ] Design algorithm registry/factory pattern for easy switching
- [ ] Plan file structure for different meshing implementations

### 4.3 Implement Alternative Meshing Algorithms
- [ ] Implement naive cube meshing (fallback/debug option)
- [ ] Implement improved greedy meshing algorithm
- [ ] Implement culled face meshing (performance option)

### 4.4 LOD System Preparation
- [ ] Review LOD requirements from game documentation
- [ ] Design mesh generation hooks for LOD levels
- [ ] Implement distance-based mesh complexity selection

### 4.5 Integration and Testing
- [ ] Implement runtime algorithm switching
- [ ] Add debug UI for meshing algorithm selection
- [ ] Performance comparison between algorithms
- [ ] Verify missing mesh issues are resolved

## Documentation References
- LOD system requirements (to be investigated)
- Performance targets for different world sizes
- Future chunk loading/unloading requirements

## Success Criteria
- No missing meshes in rendered world
- Easy switching between meshing algorithms
- Modular, maintainable code structure
- Foundation ready for LOD implementation
- Performance maintained or improved

## Status: In Progress
