## 1. Problem Description

When the greedy meshing algorithm merges multiple adjacent voxels of the same type into a single larger quad, the texture applied to this quad is stretched to fit its entire surface. This results in a distorted appearance, especially for larger merged faces.

**Current Incorrect Behavior:**
*   A 3x1 area of stone voxels will render with the stone texture stretched across the entire 3-voxel-long face.

**Desired Behavior:**
*   A 3x1 area of stone voxels should render with the stone texture tiled three times horizontally across the face. Each 1x1 section of the merged face should display one instance of the stone texture.
*   The tiling must respect the texture atlas, meaning only the specific portion of the atlas corresponding to the voxel's type should be tiled.

**Previous Incorrect Attempt:**
*   An earlier attempt to fix this resulted in the *entire texture atlas* being tiled across the merged face, rather than just the specific texture for the voxel type. This caused incorrect textures to appear (e.g., a stone surface showing parts of grass, dirt, etc., in a tiled fashion).
*   A subsequent attempt (May 14, 2025) involved calculating UVs to span a region of the atlas equivalent to `W` tiles wide and `H` tiles high (e.g., U from `tile_u_start` to `tile_u_start + W * tile_span_u`). While `GL_REPEAT` was active, this correctly selected a strip of `W` adjacent tiles from the atlas, not a repetition of the *first* tile. This is the current state leading to incorrect horizontal tiling (showing sequential atlas tiles) and vertical tiling (showing a tall strip from the atlas).

## 2. Analysis and Brainstorming

### Corrected Likely Cause & Solution Approach
The core issue is that the UV coordinates sent to the fragment shader define a rectangular region *within the texture atlas* that can span multiple individual tiles if the merged quad is wider or taller than one voxel. OpenGL's `GL_REPEAT` correctly handles wrapping for the *entire atlas texture*, but it doesn't inherently know how to repeat a *specific sub-region (a single tile)* multiple times across a surface.

**To achieve true tiling of a single voxel's texture across a merged quad, we need to perform the tiling logic primarily in the fragment shader:**

1.  **Vertex Attributes:**
    *   Vertices of a quad will carry `quad_uv` coordinates. These will range from `(0,0)` at one corner to `(quad_width_in_voxels, quad_height_in_voxels)` at the opposite corner.
    *   Vertices will also carry `atlas_tile_origin_uv`, which is the `(u,v)` coordinate of the bottom-left corner of the *specific tile* for that voxel type within the texture atlas.
2.  **Fragment Shader Logic:**
    *   The interpolated `quad_uv` (now varying from `0` to `W` or `H` across the quad) will have its fractional part taken using `fract(quad_uv)`. This yields a `(0-1, 0-1)` UV that represents the position *within a single repetition* of the texture.
    *   This `fract_uv` is then scaled by the actual normalized dimensions of a single tile in the atlas (`tile_span_u`, `tile_span_v`, passed as a uniform or derived).
    *   Finally, this scaled `fract_uv` is added to the `atlas_tile_origin_uv` to get the precise coordinate within the texture atlas to sample for the current fragment.
    *   `final_atlas_uv = atlas_tile_origin_uv + fract(quad_uv) * tile_uv_span;`

This approach ensures that for any point on the merged quad, we calculate which part of the *single designated tile* should be rendered there, effectively repeating that one tile.

### Key Areas for Modification:
1.  **Vertex Struct:** Needs to be modified to store `quad_uv` (from 0 to W/H) and `atlas_tile_origin_uv`.
2.  **MeshBuilder (`addQuad` and `addFace`):** Logic to populate these new vertex attributes.
3.  **VAO Setup (`MeshRenderer`):** Update vertex attribute pointers for the new structure.
4.  **Shaders (`voxel.vert`, `voxel.frag`):** Implement the new UV attribute passing and the fragment shader logic described above. A uniform for `tile_uv_span` (e.g., `TILE_UV_WIDTH`, `TILE_UV_HEIGHT`) will be needed.

## 3. Task List

### 3.1. Investigation & Preparation
- [x] **3.1.1. Review `TextureAtlas` Implementation:**
    - [x] Verify how to get base UV coordinates (e.g., top-left `(u,v)`) for a given voxel type/face.
        - Finding: `TextureAtlas::getTextureCoordinates(VoxelType)` returns `TextureCoordinates` struct with `uv_min` (bottom-left GL) and `uv_max` (top-right GL). `getBottomLeft()` and `getTopRight()` can be used. This `uv_min` will be our `atlas_tile_origin_uv`.
    - [x] Verify how to get the normalized width and height of a single texture tile within the atlas (e.g., `tile_normalized_width = tile_pixel_width / atlas_pixel_width`).
        - Finding: Constants `VoxelEngine::Rendering::TILE_UV_WIDTH` and `VoxelEngine::Rendering::TILE_UV_HEIGHT` provide these directly. These will be used for `u_tile_uv_span` in the shader.
    - [x] If necessary, add methods to `TextureAtlas` to easily retrieve these values.
        - Finding: No additions needed.
- [x] **3.1.2. Review OpenGL Texture Setup:**
    - [x] Locate the code where the voxel texture atlas is loaded and its OpenGL parameters are set.
        - Finding: Texture loading and parameter setup is in `MeshRenderer::loadTexture` in `engine/src/rendering/mesh_renderer.cpp`.
    - [x] Confirm or ensure that `glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_S, GL_REPEAT);` and `glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_T, GL_REPEAT);` are being called for the atlas texture.
        - Finding: Changed from `GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE` to `GL_REPEAT`. This is good practice, though with the new shader logic, its direct effect on tiling might be less critical if `final_atlas_uv` stays within tile bounds.

### 3.2. Modify UV Generation and Shader Logic
- [ ] **3.2.1. Define/Locate Vertex Struct:** Find the C++ struct definition for a `Vertex`.
- [ ] **3.2.2. Modify Vertex Struct:**
    - [ ] Change existing `texCoords` (or equivalent) to `glm::vec2 quad_uv;`.
    - [ ] Add `glm::vec2 atlas_tile_origin_uv;`.
- [ ] **3.2.3. Update `MeshBuilder::addFace` (for Naive Meshing):**
    - [ ] Populate `quad_uv` with `(0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (0,1)` for the 4 vertices.
    - [ ] Populate `atlas_tile_origin_uv` with `atlas.getTextureCoordinates(voxelType).getBottomLeft()` for all 4 vertices.
- [ ] **3.2.4. Update `MeshBuilder::addQuad` (for Greedy Meshing):**
    - [ ] Modify signature to remove `quad_width_voxels`, `quad_height_voxels` if they are only used for the old UV calculation (or pass them if still needed for determining `quad_uv` extents). The `h_quad` and `w_quad` from `buildGreedyMesh` will define the extents for `quad_uv`.
    - [ ] Populate `quad_uv` for the 4 vertices:
        *   V0: `(0.0f, 0.0f)`
        *   V1: `(static_cast<float>(actual_width_voxels), 0.0f)`
        *   V2: `(static_cast<float>(actual_width_voxels), static_cast<float>(actual_height_voxels))`
        *   V3: `(0.0f, static_cast<float>(actual_height_voxels))`
        (Ensure `actual_width_voxels` and `actual_height_voxels` correctly correspond to `h_quad`/`w_quad` based on face orientation).
    - [ ] Populate `atlas_tile_origin_uv` with `atlas.getTextureCoordinates(voxelType).getBottomLeft()` for all 4 vertices.
    - Calls to `addQuad` in `buildGreedyMesh` updated to pass `h_quad` and `w_quad`.
        - For `dir > 0` (e.g., +X, +Y, +Z faces relative to sweep), `addQuad(..., h_quad, w_quad)`.
        - For `dir < 0` (e.g., -X, -Y, -Z faces relative to sweep), `addQuad(..., w_quad, h_quad)`. *Correction: The order of `h_quad` and `w_quad` needs to be consistent with the vertex order and the intended U-V mapping of the texture on the quad. The current implementation passes `h_quad` as `quad_width_voxels` and `w_quad` as `quad_height_voxels` when `dir > 0`, and the reverse when `dir < 0`. This assumes `h_quad` consistently maps to texture U and `w_quad` to texture V, which needs verification during testing, especially concerning the vertex winding (`ovp1`, `ovp2`, `ovp3`, `ovp4`) for front vs. back faces.*
- [ ] **3.2.5. Update VAO/VBO Setup in `MeshRenderer`:**
    - [ ] Adjust `glVertexAttribPointer` calls for the new vertex layout (position, normal, `quad_uv`, `atlas_tile_origin_uv`, light). Update attribute locations if necessary.
- [ ] **3.2.6. Update Vertex Shader (`voxel.vert`):**
    - [ ] Change `in vec2 a_texCoords;` to `in vec2 a_quad_uv;` and `in vec2 a_atlas_tile_origin_uv;`.
    - [ ] Change `out vec2 v_texCoords;` to `out vec2 v_quad_uv;` and `out vec2 v_atlas_tile_origin_uv;`.
    - [ ] Assign `v_quad_uv = a_quad_uv;` and `v_atlas_tile_origin_uv = a_atlas_tile_origin_uv;`.
- [ ] **3.2.7. Update Fragment Shader (`voxel.frag`):**
    - [ ] Change `in vec2 v_texCoords;` to `in vec2 v_quad_uv;` and `in vec2 v_atlas_tile_origin_uv;`.
    - [ ] Add `uniform vec2 u_tile_uv_span;`.
    - [ ] Replace old texture coordinate usage with:
        ```glsl
        vec2 within_tile_frac_uv = fract(v_quad_uv);
        vec2 final_atlas_uv = v_atlas_tile_origin_uv + within_tile_frac_uv * u_tile_uv_span;
        // Use final_atlas_uv in texture(...) call
        ```
- [ ] **3.2.8. Set `u_tile_uv_span` Uniform:**
    - [ ] In the C++ rendering code, before drawing meshes, set the `u_tile_uv_span` uniform with `(TILE_UV_WIDTH, TILE_UV_HEIGHT)`.

### 3.3. Testing and Verification
- [ ] **3.3.1. Create Specific Test Scenarios:**
    - [ ] Test with a single voxel type forming a large flat surface (e.g., 5x1x5 stone platform).
    - [ ] Test with multiple adjacent voxel types to ensure no texture bleeding or incorrect tiling at boundaries.
    - [ ] Test on all 6 face orientations (X+, X-, Y+, Y-, Z+, Z-).
    - [ ] Test with thin structures (e.g., 1x5x1 wall).
    - [ ] Test with complex shapes combining multiple merged quads.
- [ ] **3.3.2. Visual Inspection:**
    - [ ] Confirm that the correct voxel texture is used for each merged quad.
    - [ ] Confirm that the texture tiles correctly across the merged quad surface (e.g., a 3x1 quad shows the texture repeated 3 times horizontally).
    - [ ] Check for any visual artifacts: stretching, compression, tearing, incorrect texture orientation.
    - [ ] Ensure UVs are correctly mapped based on `h_quad` and `w_quad` relative to the face orientation. The `addQuad` function assumes a specific vertex order (p1=BL, p2=BR, p3=TR, p4=TL) for UV assignment. The calls from `buildGreedyMesh` (`ovp1, ovp4, ovp3, ovp2` for `dir > 0` and `ovp1, ovp2, ovp3, ovp4` for `dir < 0`) combined with how `h_quad` and `w_quad` are passed need to result in:
        - Vertex 0 (p1 in `addQuad`): `uv_min.x`, `uv_min.y`
        - Vertex 1 (p2 in `addQuad`): `uv_min.x + W * tile_span_u`, `uv_min.y`
        - Vertex 2 (p3 in `addQuad`): `uv_min.x + W * tile_span_u`, `uv_min.y + H * tile_span_v`
        - Vertex 3 (p4 in `addQuad`): `uv_min.x`, `uv_min.y + H * tile_span_v`
        (Where W is `quad_width_voxels` and H is `quad_height_voxels` passed to `addQuad`)
- [ ] **3.3.3. Regression Test Naive Meshing:**
    - [ ] Briefly verify that naive meshing still works as expected and textures individual voxels correctly.

### 3.4. Documentation
- [ ] **3.4.1. Update Code Comments:**
    - [ ] Add comments to `MeshBuilder::addQuad` explaining the UV scaling logic.
    - [ ] Clarify comments in `buildGreedyMesh` regarding `h_quad`, `w_quad` and their relation to texture U and V dimensions when calling `addQuad`.
- [ ] **3.4.2. Update Task Files:**
    - [x] Update this task file with findings and changes.
    - [ ] Ensure the main mesh generation task file is consistent if necessary.
