# Voxel Fortress: C++ Custom Engine Development Strategy

## Current Development Status (June 2025)

**Phase 1: Foundational Voxel Engine âœ… COMPLETE**

The foundational systems have been successfully implemented and are operational:

### âœ… Completed Core Systems
- **Voxel Data Management**: Chunk-based world representation (32Â³ voxel chunks)
- **Block Type System**: Flexible block type registry with texture atlas support
- **ECS Architecture**: Flecs Entity Component System integration
- **Rendering Pipeline**: OpenGL-based voxel rendering with greedy meshing
- **Input Handling**: SDL3 input system with camera controls
- **Game Loop**: Structured game loop with delta time management
- **World Generation**: Basic procedural terrain generation
- **Memory Management**: Smart pointer-based resource management

### âœ… Current Operational Features
- Free-flying spectator camera with smooth movement
- Real-time world chunk loading/unloading based on camera position
- Interactive block placement and removal system
- Texture atlas rendering for different block types
- Debug information and performance monitoring
- Mouse capture and release system

## Phase 2: Advanced World Systems & Gameplay Features ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS

Current development focus areas:

### ðŸ”„ Active Development
- **UI Framework**: Block selection interface and game menus
- **Block Interaction**: Refinement of placement/removal mechanics
- **Game State Management**: Menu system and state transitions
- **Lighting System**: Basic lighting model for voxel rendering

### ðŸŽ¯ Next Priorities
- **Player Physics**: First-person player controller with collision
- **Advanced World Generation**: Biome systems and geological features
- **Save/Load System**: World persistence functionality
- **Performance Optimization**: LOD systems and rendering improvements

## Core Implementation Philosophy

Development emphasizes iterative improvement and maintainable code:

- **Performance First**: Profile and optimize critical systems (achieved 60 FPS target)
- **Modular Design**: Independent, testable engine systems
- **Documentation**: Clear code documentation and architectural decisions
- **Version Control**: Structured Git workflow with logical commits
## Development Practices & Guidelines

### Architecture Principles
- **Modularity**: Engine systems are designed as independent, testable components
- **Performance**: Regular profiling with 60 FPS target maintained
- **Memory Safety**: RAII and smart pointers prevent memory leaks
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive logging and error reporting

### Build & Testing
- **CMake Build System**: Cross-platform compilation support
- **Continuous Testing**: Manual testing after each major feature
- **Performance Monitoring**: Frame time tracking and chunk loading metrics
- **Debug Tools**: Console logging with categorized output levels

### Code Quality
- **Documentation**: Clear inline documentation and architectural notes
- **Version Control**: Structured Git workflow with descriptive commits
- **Code Reviews**: Peer review for major architectural changes
- **Standards**: C++17 standard with modern best practices

### Current Development Workflow
1. **Task Planning**: Detailed sub-tasks in `/development_tasks/` directory
2. **Implementation**: Focused development on single features
3. **Testing**: Build and run tests after changes
4. **Integration**: Confirm functionality before marking complete
5. **Documentation**: Update relevant documentation files
