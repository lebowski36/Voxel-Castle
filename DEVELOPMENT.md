# Voxel Fortress: Development Journal

## Implementation Strategy

After analyzing our options, we've decided to begin implementation with the **Basic Voxel System & Chunk Management** because:

1. It establishes the core data structures everything else builds upon
2. It addresses the most unique aspect of our game
3. We can validate the approach early before adding complexity
4. It focuses on core mechanics before visual concerns

## Phase 1: Basic Voxel System Implementation

Our first implementation goal is to create a functioning voxel data management system with:

- Chunk-based world representation
  - 25cm standard block size (4 blocks = 1 meter)
  - 32³ blocks per chunk (8m³ volumes)
  - Multi-resolution capability with sub-blocks (12.5cm, 6.25cm) for detail
- Block type registry
- Efficient storage and access patterns
- Basic world generation

This block size provides an optimal balance between detail and performance, allowing for detailed construction while maintaining reasonable memory usage and rendering performance.

From there, we'll build up the ECS architecture and finally add rendering to visualize our work.

## Phase 2: Hierarchical World & Chunk System

- World size is user-selectable at creation (Small, Medium, Large, Huge, Earth-sized).
- Hierarchical chunk structure: e.g., 32x32 superchunks, each containing 32x32 lower-level chunks, recursively down to 32x32x32 block chunks (25cm blocks).
- High-level worldgen (biome map, heightmap, cave map, etc.) is generated at world creation and visualized for the user.
- Only a small area (e.g., 5x5 or 9x9 chunks) is loaded and simulated around the player at any time; others are saved/unloaded.
- Distant terrain is rendered using LOD meshes from high-level data.
- Biome and cave systems are modular and extensible for future features.
- Simulation in unloaded chunks is handled at a high level, with fast-forwarding/interpolation when loaded.
- Worldgen is modular and realistic, using multi-octave noise, domain warping, erosion, river pathfinding, and climate simulation for biomes. Caves and features are placed using 3D noise and rules. All systems are designed to be extensible and to work together hierarchically.
- See `feature_docs/hierarchical_worldgen.md` for detailed design and implementation plan.

Next: Implement hierarchical worldgen data structures, high-level map generation, and chunk/block generation using this data.
