# Voxel Fortress: C++ Custom Engine Development Strategy

## Core Implementation Philosophy

Development will focus on building a robust and performant custom C++ engine tailored for Voxel Fortress. The strategy emphasizes iterative development, starting with foundational systems and progressively adding complexity.

## Phase 1: Foundational Voxel Engine (C++)

The initial development phase will concentrate on establishing the core voxel systems:

1.  **Voxel Data Management:**
    *   Implement a chunk-based world representation.
        *   Define standard block size (e.g., 25cm, allowing 4 blocks per meter).
        *   Establish chunk dimensions (e.g., 32x32x32 blocks, resulting in 8mÂ³ volumes per chunk).
        *   Consider future support for multi-resolution capabilities (e.g., sub-blocks for finer detail) if performance allows.
    *   Develop a flexible block type registry or system.
    *   Design and implement efficient C++ data structures for voxel storage and access.
    *   Lay the groundwork for basic procedural world generation.

2.  **Core Engine Architecture:**
    *   Establish the chosen Entity Component System (ECS) architecture.
    *   Implement basic rendering systems to visualize the voxel world (e.g., using OpenGL, Vulkan).
    *   Set up essential engine modules: input handling, window management, and a main game loop.

This phase aims to create a minimal viable voxel engine, allowing for early validation of core mechanics and performance characteristics.

## Phase 2: Advanced World Systems & Gameplay Features (C++)

Building upon the foundational engine, Phase 2 will expand the world's complexity and introduce gameplay elements:

1.  **Hierarchical World Structure:**
    *   Investigate and implement a hierarchical chunking system to manage large worlds efficiently. This could involve multiple levels of detail or spatial organization.
    *   Allow for user-selectable world sizes (e.g., Small, Medium, Large) with corresponding performance considerations.
    *   Develop Level of Detail (LOD) systems for rendering distant terrain and structures.

2.  **Advanced Procedural Generation:**
    *   Implement sophisticated world generation algorithms, including:
        *   Biome generation (e.g., using noise functions, climate simulation).
        *   Cave systems and other geological features.
        *   Ensure modularity and extensibility for future content.

3.  **Simulation and Gameplay Mechanics:**
    *   Address simulation of game elements, potentially including high-level simulation for unloaded or distant chunks.
    *   Begin implementing core gameplay mechanics as defined in the Game Concept documents.

## Development Practices

*   **Modularity:** Design systems to be as modular and independent as possible.
*   **Performance:** Profile and optimize critical systems regularly, especially voxel processing and rendering.
*   **Testing:** Implement unit and integration tests for core engine components.
*   **Documentation:** Maintain clear documentation for engine architecture, systems, and APIs.
*   **Version Control:** Utilize Git for version control, with a clear branching and merging strategy.

## Version Control

Regularly commit changes to Git. Each commit should represent a logical unit of work. Write clear and concise commit messages.

This document provides a high-level strategic overview. Detailed technical designs for specific systems will be maintained in their respective documentation within the `org/Tech Stack/` directory.
