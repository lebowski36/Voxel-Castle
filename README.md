# 🏰 Voxel Fortress 🏰

## Welcome to the Voxel Fortress Project!

**Voxel Fortress** is an ambitious colony simulation game that combines the depth of Dwarf Fortress with the accessibility and creative freedom of voxel-based worlds.

> "Build, dig, survive, and watch stories unfold in a vast, procedurally generated voxel world."

## 🎮 Game Concept

In Voxel Fortress, you'll:

- 👥 **Manage a thriving colony** of unique individuals with personalities, needs, and skills
- 🏗️ **Build epic structures** by digging into mountains or building on the surface
- 🌋 **Explore a vast procedurally generated world** with varied biomes and hidden secrets
- ⚔️ **Defend against threats** from the wilderness and rival factions
- 📈 **Create complex production chains** to craft advanced items and grow your fortress
- 📜 **Experience emergent storytelling** through the interactions of deep simulation systems

## 🧩 Core Features

- **Deep Colony Simulation** - Characters with unique traits, skills, relationships, and needs
- **Voxel-based Building** - Intuitive yet powerful construction system
- **Advanced LOD System** - See for miles across your procedurally generated world
- **Rich Simulation** - From fluid dynamics to complex social interactions
- **Emergent Gameplay** - No two playthroughs will ever be the same

## 🚧 Development Status

This project is currently in the early planning and design phase, with a transition to C++ for custom engine development. We're refining our game design documentation alongside initial C++ engine prototyping.

## 💡 Vision

Voxel Fortress aims to create a perfect blend between:
- The depth and emergent storytelling of Dwarf Fortress
- The accessibility and creativity of Minecraft
- Modern rendering techniques for breathtaking vistas

We believe in creating games where players create their own stories through interactions with complex, interwoven systems rather than following prescribed narratives.

## 🔧 Technology

Building a game of this ambition requires the right tools:

- **Custom Engine** built with C++ for performance, control, and leveraging mature ecosystems.
- **Entity Component System (ECS)** architecture for simulation depth and flexibility.
- **Advanced Voxel Rendering** with multiple LOD techniques, utilizing modern graphics APIs (e.g., Vulkan, OpenGL).
- **Optimized Data Structures** for managing a dynamic and massive voxel world.
