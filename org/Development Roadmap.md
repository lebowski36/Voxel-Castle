## Transition to 3D Visualization

### Goals
- Replace ASCII visualization with a 3D rendering system.
- Integrate a rendering library (e.g., `wgpu` or `bevy`) to render the voxel world in 3D.
- Implement basic camera controls and lighting for the 3D environment.

### Documentation Requirement
- Ensure that all changes related to the 3D visualization are documented in the roadmap and technical documentation.
