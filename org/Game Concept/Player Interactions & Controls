# Player Interaction & Controls

## Overview
The Player Interaction system defines how players engage with and control the Voxel Fortress game world. This system bridges the player's intent with in-game actions through intuitive controls, clear feedback, and flexible interaction modes. By balancing direct involvement with strategic management, the interaction model aims to make complex colony simulation accessible without sacrificing depth.
