# World Generation

## Overview
The World Generation system forms the foundational environment of Voxel Fortress, creating the rich, varied, and believable worlds in which colonies emerge and develop. This system combines procedural generation with complex simulations to create fully realized voxel landscapes with geological features, biomes, resources, points of interest, and even historiesâ€”all generated before the player's colony begins.

## Design Goals & Principles

### Exploration & Discovery
World generation should create a sense of wonder and reward player curiosity with interesting finds.

### Geological & Ecological Plausibility
While fantastical elements may exist, the world should follow logical patterns that players can learn and understand.

### Meaningful Player Choice
Settlement location and resource management decisions should have significant consequences based on world generation.

### Narrative Foundation
The generated world should provide rich soil from which compelling emergent stories can grow.

### Performance Balance
Generation algorithms must balance detail and realism with acceptable generation times and runtime performance.

## Chunked Voxel World
The world is divided into 32x32x32 voxel chunks (25cm per voxel, 8mÂ³ per chunk) for efficient storage and rendering. Initial implementation will use simple solid or heightmap-based chunks.

### Hierarchical World Generation & Streaming
- World size is user-selectable at creation, up to Earth-sized (tens of thousands of km).
- World is generated as a hierarchy of chunk levels, with high-level worldgen (biomes, heightmaps, caves, etc.) at the top, and detailed chunk data generated on demand.
- High-level worldgen is visualized for the user during world creation.
- Only a small area is loaded/simulated at a time; distant terrain uses LOD meshes.
- Biome and cave systems are modular and designed for future extensibility.
- Simulation in unloaded chunks is handled at a high level, with fast-forwarding/interpolation when loaded.
