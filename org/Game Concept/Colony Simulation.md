# Colony Simulation

## Overview
The colony simulation system forms the heart of Voxel Fortress, defining how your group of individuals functions as a society. This document outlines the key components and mechanics of this core gameplay system.

## Core Components

### Population Management

#### Colonist Acquisition
- **Race:** Colonists belong to different races, each with unique traits, abilities, and cultural tendencies. Races influence colonist behavior, relationships, and colony dynamics. Players can encounter and integrate multiple races into their colony, fostering diversity
- **Immigration:** New colonists arrive based on fortress wealth, reputation, and living conditions
- **Birth:** Colonists can form relationships and have children (longer-term investment, children take time to mature)
- **Rescue:** Occasionally find stranded/imprisoned individuals who can join your colony
- **Recruitment:** Convert prisoners or visitors to your cause based on social skills and treatment

#### Demographics
- **Age Groups:** Children, adults, elders - each with different capabilities and needs
- **Life Cycle:** Colonists age over time, affecting their stats, skills, and eventually leading to natural death
- **Population Cap:** Dynamic system based on available resources, space, and management capability

### Social Dynamics

#### Relationships
- **Formation:** Colonists develop relationships based on proximity, shared activities, compatibility
- **Types:** Friends, rivals, romantic partners, family bonds
- **Effects:** Relationships affect work efficiency, mood, and colony stability
- **Network Visualization:** UI tool to view the web of relationships in your colony

#### Hierarchy
- **Leadership:** Colonists may naturally emerge as leaders based on social skills and accomplishments
- **Social Status:** Develops based on achievements, assigned quarters, special equipment
- **Authority:** Affects how well orders are followed and conflicts are resolved

#### Factions
- **Internal Groups:** Colonists may form informal factions based on shared traits, professions, or beliefs
- **Rivalries:** Competing interests between groups can create internal tension
- **Management:** Requires balancing attention and resources across different factions

### Culture & Identity

#### Colony Values
- **Ethos:** Gradually develops based on player decisions and colonist backgrounds
- **Traditions:** Regular events and practices that boost morale but require resources
- **Taboos:** Actions or behaviors that your colony considers unacceptable

#### Cultural Expression
- **Art & Artifacts:** Colonists create art reflecting colony experiences and values
- **Architecture:** Building styles influence colony identity and colonist satisfaction
- **History:** Important events are recorded and remembered, affecting colony behavior

### Governance

#### Decision Systems
- **Leadership Models:** Dictatorial, council-based, democratic, etc.
- **Laws & Policies:** Set rules for behavior, resource distribution, work priorities
- **Enforcement:** Methods for ensuring compliance with colony rules

#### Justice System
- **Crime Detection:** Based on witnesses and evidence
- **Trials:** Determining guilt based on social skills and evidence
- **Punishment:** Options from labor assignment to exile, affecting colony morale

## Technical Implementation Considerations

### Data Structures & Algorithms
- **Colonist Records:** Comprehensive datasets for each individual
- **Relationship Graphs:** Network representation of interpersonal connections
- **Event History:** Significant happenings affecting colony development
- **Entity Management:** Efficiently handling thousands of colonists, creatures, and items. *(Consider C++ data structures like `std::vector` for contiguous data, `std::unordered_map` for fast lookups, or custom pool allocators for performance-critical objects.)*
- **Pathfinding:** Robust A* or similar for complex 3D voxel environments

### Simulation Systems
- **Time Scale:** Colony simulation runs on a separate tick rate from real-time gameplay
- **Priority Queue:** Events scheduled to occur at specific times/conditions
- **Monte Carlo Methods:** For modeling social interactions and decision-making

### Performance Optimization
- **Instanced Processing:** Similar colonists batched for parallel computation
- **LOD for AI:** Lower simulation fidelity for distant/less important colonists
- **Caching Social Networks:** Precompute relationship effects
- **Simulation Tick Rate:** Balancing detail with computational cost. *(C++ allows for fine-grained memory management and optimization techniques to maximize performance.)*
- **Parallelization:** Identifying parts of the simulation that can run concurrently

## Design Goals & Principles

### Emergence > Scripting
Prioritize systems that generate interesting situations over pre-scripted events. The most memorable stories should emerge organically from system interactions.

### Meaningful Decisions
Every management choice should present interesting trade-offs with both short and long-term consequences.

### Observable Systems
While complex internally, systems should be transparent enough that players can understand cause and effect.

### Personality Over Efficiency
Colonists should feel like individuals with quirks and flaws rather than optimized worker units.

### Failure is Interesting
Colony setbacks and even collapse should generate compelling narratives - losing can be fun when the story is good.
