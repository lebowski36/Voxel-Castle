# Voxel Fortress Tech Stack (Rust Custom Engine Approach)

This document provides a high-level overview of our technical approach to building Voxel Fortress. Given the ambitious requirements outlined in our [Game Concept Documentation](./Game%20Concept/), we've chosen a custom Rust-based engine to achieve the necessary performance, control, and flexibility.

> For detailed technical specifications, implementation guides, architecture diagrams, and subsystem documentation, see our comprehensive [Technical Documentation](./Tech%20Stack/) folder.

## A. Engine Philosophy

Building a custom engine is a strategic decision based on Voxel Fortress's unique requirements:

- Handling vast voxel worlds with [extreme view distances](./Game%20Concept/Rendering%20Systems.md)
- Supporting [deep simulation](./Game%20Concept/Colony%20Simulation.md) of hundreds of entities
- Managing complex [physics systems](./Game%20Concept/Physics%20Systems.md) in a destructible environment
- Implementing sophisticated [AI behaviors](./Game%20Concept/AI%20Systems.md) with custom pathfinding

Using Rust as our foundation provides critical advantages for these challenges, particularly in performance, memory safety, and concurrency.
