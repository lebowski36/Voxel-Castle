# Voxel Fortress Tech Stack (Rust Custom Engine Approach)

Given the specific requirements (deep simulation, large-scale dynamic voxel world, custom LOD) and the decision to pursue maximum control and potential performance, building a custom game engine using Rust is a viable, albeit extremely challenging, path.

## A. Game Engine

### Custom Engine Built with Rust
This approach involves building the engine's core functionalities from scratch or by integrating various Rust libraries (crates).

#### Pros
- **Ultimate Control**: Every system can be tailored precisely to the game's unique needs (simulation, voxel handling, LOD)
- **Performance Potential**: Rust's focus on performance and low-level control allows for highly optimized code, crucial for simulation and rendering demands
- **Memory Safety**: Rust's ownership and borrowing system eliminates many common memory-related bugs (segfaults, data races) prevalent in C/C++, leading to more stable and secure code, especially important for complex, long-running simulations
- **Excellent Concurrency**: Rust has first-class support for concurrency, vital for parallelizing tasks like chunk processing, AI, and LOD generation
- **Growing Ecosystem**: The Rust game development ecosystem is rapidly maturing, with high-quality libraries available for many core tasks

#### Cons
- **Massive Development Effort**: You are essentially rebuilding functionalities provided by commercial engines (rendering pipeline, physics integration, asset management, scene graph, UI tools, platform abstractions). This requires significant time, resources, and expertise
- **Requires Deep Expertise**: Success demands strong knowledge of engine architecture, graphics programming, systems programming, simulation design, and the Rust language itself
- **Smaller Community/Asset Pool**: While growing, finding pre-made solutions or extensive tutorials for highly specific problems might be harder than with mainstream engines like UE/Unity

## B. Programming Language

### Primary: Rust
The core engine, simulation logic, rendering pipeline, and most gameplay systems would be written in Rust to leverage its performance, safety, and concurrency features.

### Potential Secondary Languages
- **Scripting** (e.g., Lua via mlua, or Rhai): Could be integrated for high-level gameplay logic, modding support, or rapid prototyping of certain features, separating them from the core Rust engine code
- **C/C++ (via FFI)**: Only if absolutely necessary to bind to existing, indispensable C/C++ libraries that lack mature Rust bindings. This adds complexity and potentially compromises safety guarantees. The goal would be to minimize or avoid this

## C. Key Rust Libraries/Crates & Techniques

### Architecture
- **Entity Component System (ECS)**: Highly recommended. Options include bevy_ecs (mature, feature-rich, part of the Bevy engine but usable standalone), specs (older but established, uses generational arenas), or flecs-rs (bindings to the C Flecs library). ECS is ideal for managing potentially thousands of entities (colonists, creatures, items) and their properties, and facilitates parallel processing of simulation logic

### Rendering
- **Graphics API Abstraction**: wgpu is the de facto standard. It provides a modern, safe, and relatively platform-agnostic API over Vulkan, Metal, DirectX12, OpenGL ES, and WebGPU. This is likely the foundation of the rendering pipeline
- **Lower-Level Access (Advanced)**: Crates like ash (Vulkan), metal-rs (Metal), windows-rs (DirectX) offer direct access if wgpu proves insufficient, but significantly increase complexity

### Windowing & Input
- **winit**: The standard crate for creating windows and handling input events across different platforms. Integrates seamlessly with wgpu

### Voxel-Specific Systems (Likely requires significant custom code)
- **Voxel Storage**: Custom implementations of chunked arrays, possibly combined with Octrees (ultraviolet has math types, but data structures are often custom) or spatial hashing techniques. Efficient storage and querying are critical
- **Meshing**: Crates like block-mesh-rs (greedy meshing) or dual-contouring-rs might provide starting points, but will likely need adaptation or custom implementations for performance, specific block types, and integration with the LOD system. Marching Cubes algorithms would also likely be custom implementations
- **LOD Generation**: Almost certainly requires custom algorithms tailored to the voxel data structure and desired visual output for different distance levels

### Physics
- **rapier**: A popular, robust 2D/3D physics engine written in Rust. Needs integration with the ECS and the voxel world (handling collisions with dynamic terrain)

### Concurrency & Parallelism
- **Rust Standard Library**: std::thread, async/await for asynchronous tasks
- **rayon**: Excellent library for easy data parallelism (e.g., parallel iteration over chunks for processing or meshing)
- **crossbeam**: Provides more advanced concurrency primitives (channels, scoped threads, etc.)

### AI & Pathfinding
- **pathfinding**: Provides standard algorithms like A*, Dijkstra. Needs adaptation for the 3D voxel grid and potentially hierarchical pathfinding for scale
- Behavioral AI (needs, moods, job selection) will be mostly custom logic, likely leveraging the ECS

### UI
- **egui**: A very popular and easy-to-use immediate-mode GUI library. Integrates well with wgpu via adapters like egui-wgpu. Good for debug interfaces and potentially the main game UI
- **iced**: An alternative, Elm-inspired stateful GUI library

### Math
- **glam or nalgebra**: Widely used linear algebra libraries for vectors, matrices, quaternions, essential for 3D graphics and physics. glam is often preferred for its SIMD support and integration with other ecosystem crates

### Serialization
- **serde**: The standard for serialization/deserialization. Essential for saving/loading game state, configuration files, potentially network communication. Used with formats like bincode (binary), ron (Rusty Object Notation), or JSON
- **Asset Handling**: Custom systems will be needed for loading, managing, and potentially hot-reloading assets (textures, models, configuration)

## D. Supporting Tools

- **Version Control**: Git (essential)
- **Project Management**: Jira, Trello, Asana, HacknPlan, etc.
- **Voxel Art**: MagicaVoxel, Goxel, Qubicle
- **Modeling/Texturing**: Blender, Krita/GIMP/Photoshop
- **Build System/CI**: Cargo (Rust's built-in build system and package manager), potentially GitHub Actions/GitLab CI for continuous integration

## Conclusion

Choosing a custom Rust engine is opting for the most challenging but potentially most rewarding path for this specific game concept. It offers unparalleled control and performance potential, leveraging Rust's strengths in safety and concurrency. However, it necessitates a significant investment in building foundational engine components before focusing purely on gameplay, requiring a team with strong systems programming expertise.
