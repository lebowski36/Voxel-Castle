# Voxel Fortress Tech Stack (C++ Custom Engine Approach)

## 1. Core Philosophy

This document outlines the proposed technology stack for Voxel Fortress, centered around a custom game engine built primarily with C++. The choice of C++ is driven by the need for maximum performance, low-level system control, and access to a mature ecosystem of libraries and tools essential for a project of this scale and complexity. We aim to build a highly optimized, multithreaded engine capable of handling vast voxel worlds, complex AI simulations, and advanced rendering techniques.

## 2. Core Language & Build System

*   **Programming Language:** C++ (targeting C++17 or C++20 for modern features and compatibility).
    *   **Rationale:** Offers unparalleled performance, direct memory management, and a vast ecosystem. Modern C++ features enhance safety and developer productivity.
*   **Build System:** CMake
    *   **Rationale:** Cross-platform, widely adopted, and well-supported by IDEs and C++ communities. Manages complex dependencies and build configurations effectively.
*   **Compiler:** Clang or GCC on Linux/macOS, MSVC on Windows.
    *   **Rationale:** Adherence to C++ standards, excellent optimization capabilities, and good tooling support.

## 3. Rendering

*   **Graphics API:** Vulkan
    *   **Rationale:** Provides explicit, low-level control over the GPU, essential for achieving high performance with vast view distances and complex voxel rendering. Enables advanced techniques like multi-threaded command buffer generation. Offers better performance characteristics on modern hardware compared to OpenGL for demanding applications.
*   **Shader Language:** GLSL (compiled to SPIR-V for Vulkan)
    *   **Rationale:** Widely understood, good tooling support, and the standard for Vulkan.
*   **Windowing & Input:** SDL2 (Simple DirectMedia Layer) or GLFW
    *   **Rationale:** Cross-platform libraries for creating windows, handling OpenGL/Vulkan contexts, and processing user input (keyboard, mouse, controllers). SDL2 offers a broader range of multimedia support, while GLFW is more lightweight and focused on OpenGL/Vulkan context management.
*   **Mesh Generation:** Custom algorithms for voxel meshing (e.g., Greedy Meshing, Marching Cubes for smoother LODs if applicable) optimized for performance.
*   **LOD System:** Custom implementation focusing on hierarchical LODs, impostors, and potentially voxel-to-polygon conversions for distant terrain.

## 4. Physics

*   **Physics Engine:** Bullet Physics SDK or PhysX (if licensing permits and aligns with project needs)
    *   **Rationale:** Mature, feature-rich, open-source (Bullet) or high-performance (PhysX) 3D physics libraries. Capable of handling rigid body dynamics, collision detection, and potentially fluid simulation. A custom, simplified physics system might be developed for specific voxel interactions if full simulation is too costly.
*   **Voxel Physics:** Custom solutions for block stability, cave-ins, and basic fluid dynamics (e.g., cellular automata for water/lava spread).

## 5. Entity Component System (ECS)

*   **ECS Framework:** EnTT or a custom-developed ECS.
    *   **Rationale:** EnTT is a well-regarded, header-only, C++17 library known for its speed and ease of use. A custom ECS can be tailored specifically to the game's needs for maximum performance and memory layout control, which is critical for simulating many entities.
*   **Design:** Focus on data-oriented design to maximize cache efficiency and enable efficient parallel processing of game logic.

## 6. Artificial Intelligence

*   **Pathfinding:** A* (A-star) or variants (e.g., Hierarchical Pathfinding HPA*) adapted for 3D voxel environments and large scale. Jump Point Search (JPS) could be explored for grid-based movement.
*   **Behavior Trees & State Machines:** For modeling complex colonist and creature behaviors. Libraries like `BehaviorTree.CPP` could be integrated.
*   **Decision Making:** Utility AI, Goal-Oriented Action Planning (GOAP) for sophisticated NPC decision-making.
*   **Group AI:** Flocking algorithms, squad-based tactics for hostile factions.

## 7. World Generation & Management

*   **Procedural Generation:** Noise algorithms (Perlin, Simplex, OpenSimplex2, Worley) for terrain heightmaps, biome distribution, and resource placement.
*   **Voxel Data Structures:** Octrees, Spatial Hashing, or Chunk-based systems with optimized storage (e.g., run-length encoding for homogeneous areas). Focus on efficient querying and modification.
*   **Streaming:** Asynchronous loading/unloading of world chunks to support vast, seamless worlds.

## 8. UI (User Interface)

*   **In-Game UI:** A custom UI solution built with a retained-mode or immediate-mode GUI library. Options include:
    *   **Dear ImGui:** Excellent for developer tools and debug interfaces. Can be adapted for in-game UI but might require more work for complex styling and layouts.
    *   **Integrating a dedicated UI library:** e.g., RmlUi (HTML/CSS based), NoesisGUI (XAML based, commercial), or a custom solution leveraging the rendering engine.
*   **Data Visualization:** Custom rendering for displaying complex simulation information effectively.

## 9. Audio

*   **Audio Engine:** OpenAL Soft or a higher-level library like SoLoud or FMOD/Wwise (commercial options offer advanced tooling).
    *   **Rationale:** OpenAL Soft provides cross-platform 3D audio. Higher-level libraries simplify audio management and offer more features.
*   **Sound Generation:** Procedural audio elements for environmental sounds where appropriate.

## 10. Networking (Future Consideration)

*   **Low-Level Sockets:** C++ standard library or OS-specific APIs for foundational networking if multiplayer becomes a goal.
*   **Libraries:** Libraries like ENet (reliable UDP) or Boost.Asio could be used for more robust networking.
*   **Replication:** Custom state synchronization and replication strategies tailored for a voxel simulation.

## 11. Data Management & Serialization

*   **Serialization Format:** Protocol Buffers, FlatBuffers, or a custom binary format for saving/loading game state and for data assets.
    *   **Rationale:** Efficiency in terms of speed and size is crucial for large world states.
*   **Asset Pipeline:** Custom tools or scripts (e.g., Python) for processing and packaging game assets.

## 12. Concurrency & Multithreading

*   **Threading Model:** Task-based parallelism using a thread pool.
    *   **Rationale:** Leverage modern multi-core CPUs effectively for simulation, rendering, world generation, and other heavy computations.
*   **Primitives:** C++ standard library features (`<thread>`, `<mutex>`, `<atomic>`, `<future>`) and potentially lock-free data structures for performance-critical sections.

## 13. Scripting (Optional)

*   **Language:** Lua or Wren.
    *   **Rationale:** Lightweight, embeddable scripting languages for gameplay logic, modding support, or rapid prototyping of certain features. Allows for faster iteration than recompiling C++ code.
*   **Binding:** Libraries like Sol2 (for Lua) or custom C++ bindings.

## 14. Development Tools & Practices

*   **Version Control:** Git
*   **IDE:** Visual Studio Code, CLion, or Visual Studio (on Windows).
*   **Debugging:** GDB, LLDB, Visual Studio Debugger. Profiling tools like Valgrind, Perf, Tracy Profiler, or platform-specific profilers.
*   **Testing:** Unit testing frameworks (e.g., Google Test, Catch2) and integration testing.
*   **Continuous Integration (CI):** GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Jenkins for automated builds and tests.

This tech stack provides a robust foundation for developing Voxel Fortress, balancing performance, control, and access to a rich ecosystem of tools and libraries. The custom engine approach allows for deep optimization tailored to the unique demands of the game.
