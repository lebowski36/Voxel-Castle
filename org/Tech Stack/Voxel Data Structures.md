# Voxel Data Structures

## Overview
The Voxel Data Structures system forms the foundation of Voxel Fortress's world representation, providing efficient storage, access, and manipulation of massive voxel environments. This document details our approach to organizing voxel data, from basic block storage to advanced spatial partitioning techniques, with a focus on balancing memory efficiency, processing speed, and simulation fidelity. Our implementation leverages custom data structures optimized specifically for the unique requirements of a deep colony simulation within a vast, modifiable voxel world.
