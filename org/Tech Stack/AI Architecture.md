# AI Architecture

## Overview
The AI Architecture of Voxel Fortress provides the technical foundation for intelligent entity behavior throughout the game. Designed to support hundreds of simultaneously active entities with believable, responsive behaviors, our AI implementation balances simulation depth with performance considerations. Built around a custom behavior tree system with hierarchical pathfinding, the architecture enables complex decision-making, efficient navigation in dynamic voxel environments, and emergent social interactions that drive the game's colony simulation.
