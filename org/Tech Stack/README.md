## Current Implementation Status (Transition to C++)

This section will be updated as the C++ implementation progresses. The previous Rust-based status is archived.

Initial C++ engine development will focus on:

1.  **Core C++ Foundation:**
    *   Establishing the C++ build system (CMake).
    *   Implementing core data structures and utilities.
    *   Setting up the main loop and windowing (e.g., using SDL2 or GLFW).
    *   Basic memory management strategies (smart pointers, initial custom allocators).

2.  **C++ ECS Implementation:**
    *   Selection or development of a C++ ECS library (e.g., EnTT, Flecs, or custom).
    *   Basic entity and component management.

3.  **C++ Rendering Basics:**
    *   Integration of a C++ graphics API abstraction (e.g., BGFX, Sokol, or direct Vulkan/DX12/Metal).
    *   Simple shape or voxel rendering.

4.  **C++ Physics Integration:**
    *   Selection and initial integration of a C++ physics engine (e.g., Jolt, PhysX).

## Next Implementation Priorities (C++ Engine)

Priorities will be defined as the C++ foundation is established. Generally, they will follow a similar trajectory to the original plan but with C++ technologies:

1.  **Parallelism & Job System (C++).**
2.  **Advanced Rendering (C++):** LOD, meshing, lighting.
3.  **Voxel World Systems (C++):** Procedural generation, block interactions.
4.  **AI & Simulation (C++).**
