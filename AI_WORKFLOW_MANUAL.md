## üéØ Purpose & Philosophy

This document establishes my autonomous development workflow for the Voxel Fortress project. It defines how I should approach any task, make decisions, and maintain quality while working independently within the established project vision.

### Core Philosophy
- **Autonomous but Accountable**: Work independently but always align with project vision
- **Quality over Speed**: Prefer correct, maintainable solutions over quick fixes
- **Iterative Excellence**: Small, verified steps toward perfection
- **Documentation-Driven**: Every decision should be traceable and documented
- **User-Centric**: Always consider the end-user experience and project goals

---

## üìã Universal Task Approach Framework

### Phase 1: Context & Understanding (ALWAYS FIRST)
**Duration: 10-15% of task time**

1. **Review Project Vision**
   - Read relevant design documents in `docs/design_specifications/`
   - Understand how this task fits into the larger game concept
   - Identify acceptance criteria from design docs

2. **Analyze Current State**
   - Use `semantic_search` to understand existing implementation
   - Identify what's been done, what's broken, what's missing
   - Map dependencies and integration points

3. **Define Success Criteria**
   - What does "done" look like for this specific task?
   - What should the user see/experience?
   - What technical requirements must be met?

### Phase 2: Strategic Planning (CRITICAL)
**Duration: 15-20% of task time**

1. **Create Working Document**
   - Always create a helper file for complex tasks (like this UI_SYSTEM_ANALYSIS.md)
   - Document my understanding, theories, and planned approach
   - Establish clear milestones and checkpoints

2. **Risk Assessment**
   - What could go wrong?
   - What are the unknowns?
   - What are the dependencies?

3. **Implementation Strategy**
   - Break down into small, testable increments
   - Define fallback approaches
   - Plan verification steps

### Phase 3: Incremental Implementation (CORE WORK)
**Duration: 60-70% of task time**

1. **Start Simple, Build Complexity**
   - Always begin with the simplest possible working version
   - Add complexity incrementally
   - Test after every meaningful change

2. **Follow Build-Test-Verify Cycle**
   - Make one focused change
   - Build immediately: `clear && cmake --build "/home/system-x1/Projects/Voxel Castle/build"`
   - Test: `clear && "/home/system-x1/Projects/Voxel Castle/build/bin/VoxelFortressGame"`
   - Verify the change worked as expected
   - Document findings and proceed

3. **Maintain Integration Integrity**
   - Ensure changes don't break existing functionality
   - Keep the project in a runnable state
   - Update documentation as I go

### Phase 4: Validation & Documentation (ESSENTIAL)
**Duration: 10-15% of task time**

1. **Comprehensive Testing**
   - Test happy path scenarios
   - Test edge cases and error conditions
   - Verify performance impact

2. **Update Documentation**
   - Update task files to reflect completion
   - Document any design decisions or trade-offs
   - Update any relevant technical documentation

3. **User Handoff Preparation**
   - Prepare clear explanation of what was accomplished
   - Identify what the user should see/experience
   - Document any remaining work or known issues

## üß† Decision-Making Framework

### When to Make Autonomous Decisions
- **Technical implementation details** (data structures, algorithms, code organization)
- **Standard practices** (error handling, logging, memory management)
- **Performance optimizations** that don't change behavior
- **Code quality improvements** (refactoring, documentation)

### When to Consult User
- **Architecture changes** that affect multiple systems
- **Feature scope changes** beyond original requirements
- **Third-party library additions** or major dependencies
- **Breaking changes** to existing APIs or interfaces
- **Design decisions** that affect user experience

### Decision Documentation
- **Why**: Document the reasoning behind decisions
- **Alternatives**: Note what other options were considered
- **Trade-offs**: Explain what was sacrificed and gained
- **Future**: Note any future considerations or migration paths

---

## üîß Technical Excellence Standards

### Code Quality
- **Readability**: Code should be self-documenting
- **Maintainability**: Easy to modify and extend
- **Performance**: Efficient but not premature optimization
- **Safety**: Proper error handling and resource management

### Testing Strategy
- **Incremental**: Test after every meaningful change
- **Visual**: For graphics/UI, always verify visual output
- **Integration**: Ensure new code works with existing systems
- **Edge Cases**: Test boundary conditions and error scenarios

### Documentation Standards
- **Inline Comments**: Explain WHY, not WHAT
- **Header Comments**: Document public interfaces
- **Design Documents**: Update when making architectural changes
- **User Documentation**: Keep end-user docs current

## üîÑ Iteration & Learning Cycle

### My Learning Process
1. **Hypothesis Formation**: Based on analysis and documentation
2. **Rapid Experimentation**: Small, focused tests of hypotheses
3. **Evidence Collection**: Gather data from build/test results
4. **Theory Refinement**: Update understanding based on evidence
5. **Knowledge Documentation**: Record learnings for future reference

### Handling Blockers
1. **First Attempt**: Use existing knowledge and documentation
2. **Research Phase**: Search codebase and external resources
3. **Alternative Approaches**: Try different implementation strategies
4. **User Consultation**: If blocking progress, consult user with context

### Continuous Improvement
- **Reflect**: After each task, consider what went well/poorly
- **Adapt**: Adjust approach based on learnings
- **Document**: Record process improvements in this file
- **Apply**: Use learnings in subsequent tasks

## üìÅ Project-Specific Guidelines

### Voxel Fortress Context
- **Game Vision**: Colony simulation + voxel building + deep systems
- **Target Experience**: Accessible Dwarf Fortress with modern graphics
- **Technical Goals**: Custom C++ engine, high performance, modular design

### Key Design Principles (from design docs)
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Start simple, reveal complexity gradually
- **Direct Manipulation**: Interact with objects, not abstract menus
- **Information Hierarchy**: Most critical data emphasized
- **Context Sensitivity**: UI adapts to current activity
- **Performance First**: 60fps target with large voxel worlds

### Integration Requirements
- **ECS Architecture**: Use Flecs for all game entities
- **OpenGL Rendering**: Modern OpenGL with shader-based pipeline
- **Modular Design**: Systems should be loosely coupled
- **Cross-Platform**: Linux primary, Windows/Mac future targets

---

## üéÆ User Experience Focus

### Always Consider
- **What will the user see?** Visual feedback for every interaction
- **How will they understand it?** Clear, intuitive interfaces
- **What if something goes wrong?** Graceful error handling
- **How does this fit the game vision?** Alignment with design goals

### Quality Gates
- **Functional**: Does it work as intended?
- **Visual**: Does it look correct and polished?
- **Performance**: Does it maintain target framerate?
- **Usability**: Is it intuitive and responsive?

---

## üöÄ Task Completion Standards

### Definition of Done
1. **Functionality**: Meets all acceptance criteria
2. **Integration**: Works with existing systems
3. **Performance**: No significant performance degradation
4. **Documentation**: Updated to reflect changes
5. **Testing**: Verified through build and runtime testing

### Handoff Checklist
- [ ] Task objectives accomplished
- [ ] Code builds without errors
- [ ] Application runs and functions correctly
- [ ] Visual verification of changes completed
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] User can reproduce the results
- [ ] Next steps (if any) clearly identified
