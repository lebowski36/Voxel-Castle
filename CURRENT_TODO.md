# CURRENT_TODO.md - Active Development Tracking

## üöÄ Current Focus: Enhanced World Generation with the 257-Block System

This file tracks our immediate high-level tasks and progress. Detailed sub-tasks for each item are located in corresponding files within the `/home/system-x1/Projects/Voxel Castle/development_tasks/` directory.

**IMPORTANT: This file is updated after each major development step is confirmed as complete by the user. The agent works from detailed sub-task files.**

## üèóÔ∏è WORLD SCALE & HEIGHT BOUNDARIES

**Essential Scale Reference:**
- **Voxel Size:** 25cm √ó 25cm √ó 25cm (0.25m cubes) - NOT 1 meter blocks
- **Chunk Size:** 32√ó32√ó32 voxels = 8m √ó 8m √ó 8m per chunk
- **World Height:** ¬±256 chunks (¬±2048m) = 4096m total = 16384 blocks total
- **Current Terrain:** ~12m max height (temporary, will expand to full range)

**Detailed Specifications:** See `docs/BIOME_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` ‚Üí World Scale & Height Boundaries
**Implementation Tasks:** See `development_tasks/04_essential_game_infrastructure/08c_world_generation_system.md`
**Height Increase Summary:** See `docs/WORLD_HEIGHT_INCREASE_SUMMARY.md` for benefits and technical details

## ü§ñ AGENT OPERATIONAL PROTOCOL

This protocol outlines how the AI agent (GitHub Copilot) operates. Adherence to these guidelines is crucial for effective collaboration.

### üö® TECHNICAL DEBT PREVENTION PROTOCOL

**CRITICAL RULE: NO QUICK FIXES WITHOUT USER CONSULTATION**

Before implementing ANY solution that could be considered a "quick fix" or architectural shortcut, the agent MUST:

1. **Identify the Problem Clearly**: State the exact technical challenge or performance issue
2. **Present Multiple Approaches**: Offer at least 2-3 different solution strategies with their trade-offs
3. **Explain Complexity vs. Results**: Detail implementation complexity and expected immediate results for each approach
4. **Request User Decision**: Ask which approach the user prefers before proceeding
5. **Document the Decision**: Update relevant documentation files to reflect the chosen architectural approach

**Examples of decisions requiring consultation:**
- Performance optimization strategies (e.g., caching, LOD systems, threading)
- Data structure changes (e.g., switching from arrays to maps, memory layout)
- Architectural patterns (e.g., observer pattern, state machines, component systems)
- UI responsiveness solutions (e.g., background processing, progressive loading, snapshot systems)
- Scale bridging approaches (e.g., sampling strategies, interpolation methods)

**The user prioritizes well-thought-through solutions over quick results, but still wants to see immediate progress without architectural compromises.**

### I. Core Collaborative Workflow (The Primary Loop)
1.  **Task Identification:** Focus on a single, open sub-task from the relevant `development_tasks/*.md` file.
    *   If a detailed sub-task file is missing for a new high-level task, create it first, outlining steps.
    *   **If a sub-task involves multiple distinct steps or actions, break it down into clearly defined sub-sub-tasks within the `development_tasks/*.md` file before starting implementation.**
2.  **Implementation:** Perform coding, documentation, or other actions required for the sub-task.
    *   Consult design documents in `docs/design_specifications/` for new features/major changes.
    *   Maintain small, focused files.
3.  **Execution & Testing:**
    *   Run necessary commands (e.g., build, run application) using the `run_in_terminal` tool, providing an explanation.
    *   **üî• CRITICAL COMMAND EXECUTION PROTOCOL:** 
        *   **ALWAYS use `clear &&` prefix** for commands producing significant output (e.g., `clear && cmake --build ...`, `clear && python script.py`). 
        *   **State explicitly that the console is being cleared** in the explanation.
        *   **This improves context window management and output readability.**
    *   Test thoroughly after each significant change to verify outcomes and check for regressions by running the application or specific tests.
4.  **User Confirmation & Decision Making:**
    *   **üî• CRITICAL OUTPUT PROTOCOL:** If command output is incomplete, cut off, or not received, **ALWAYS ask the user for the complete output** instead of re-running commands or making assumptions.
    *   **Example: "I didn't receive the complete output from the build command. Could you please share the full output?"**
    *   Pause and explicitly await user confirmation of build/test results (success, failure, observations).
    *   **CRUCIAL DECISIONS:** Discuss and confirm ALL crucial decisions (e.g., library choices, major architectural changes), unrecoverable errors, or blocking questions with the user BEFORE proceeding.
    *   **TASK COMPLETION CONFIRMATION: The agent MUST NOT mark any task or sub-task as complete in ANY `.md` file (including `development_tasks` files or `CURRENT_TODO.md`) without first proposing the completion to the user and receiving an explicit affirmative response (e.g., "yes", "okay", "confirmed"). The agent should state what it believes is complete and ask "Is it okay to mark this as complete?".**
5.  **Task & Documentation Update (Post-User Confirmation):**
    *   **Only after explicit user confirmation (see point 4 above),** use `insert_edit_into_file` to mark the sub-task as complete in the `development_tasks/*.md` file.
    *   If all sub-tasks for a high-level task are done, propose updating this `CURRENT_TODO.md` to mark the high-level task complete (again, requiring explicit user confirmation).
    *   Document findings, solutions, and design decisions in relevant files (task files, `org/` docs).
    *   **TIMESTAMPS IN TASK FILES:** All Markdown task files in `development_tasks/` should include:
        * `Created: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` timestamp at the top of new files
        * `Last Updated: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` timestamp that is updated whenever 
        changes are made to the file
        * When a file has no created timestamp and you update it you have to set the created to "UNKNOWN" but still set the last updated timestamp
        * Always fetch the current date and time before adding or updating timestamps
        * Use the format matching the current date in context (e.g., 2025-06-05 16:45)
        * These timestamps apply only to task documentation files, not code files
6.  **Progression:** Proceed to the next open sub-task. If any part of the process or a specific task is unclear, ask for clarification.

### II. Code Standards & Naming/Capitalization Protocol

**üî• CRITICAL: DUAL-PATH WORLD GENERATION ARCHITECTURE**

The project maintains **TWO SEPARATE WORLD GENERATION SYSTEMS** to ensure stability and progressive development:

**Legacy System (Resume Game Path):**
- **File**: `engine/src/world/world_generator.cpp`
- **What it does**: Simple noise-based terrain generation (~12m height max), basic caves, functional but limited
- **Purpose**: Maintain existing "Resume Game" functionality as working reference
- **Status**: **PRESERVED** - Do not modify unless absolutely necessary
- **UI**: Main menu "Resume Game" button
- **Rationale**: Provides stable, tested world generation that always works while new system is developed

**New Advanced System (Create/Load World Path):**
- **Files**: `engine/src/world/seed_world_generator.cpp` + biome system
- **What it will do**: Advanced biome system, ¬±2048m terrain range, climate simulation, erosion, geological features
- **Purpose**: Revolutionary world generation with realistic geological and ecological features
- **Status**: **ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT** - Following BIOME_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
- **UI**: Main menu "Create World" and "Load Game" buttons (future implementation)
- **Rationale**: Independent development allows optimal design for advanced features without compatibility constraints

**DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY**: Build new system to feature parity, then surpass legacy with advanced features. Once complete, legacy system can be removed. No compatibility needed between systems - they are completely separate code paths.

**üî• CRITICAL: STRICT NAMING/CAPITALIZATION STANDARD**

This project enforces a **strict naming and capitalization standard** to prevent recurring build errors and maintain consistency. ALL code MUST follow these conventions:

**C++ NAMING CONVENTIONS:**
- **Classes/Structs/Enums:** `PascalCase` (e.g., `BiomeType`, `BiomeData`, `BiomeRegistry`)
- **Functions/Methods:** `PascalCase` (e.g., `IsValidBiomeType()`, `BiomeTypeToString()`, `GetBiomeName()`)
- **Variables/Parameters:** `camelCase` (e.g., `biomeType`, `biomeName`, `temperatureRange`)
- **Constants/Enum Values:** `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` (e.g., `GRASSLAND`, `DESERT`, `TAIGA`)
- **File Names:** `snake_case` (e.g., `biome_types.h`, `biome_data.cpp`)
- **Macros:** `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` (e.g., `DEBUG_LOG`, `TEXTURE_ATLAS_SIZE`)

**NAMESPACE CONVENTIONS:**
- **Namespaces:** `PascalCase` (e.g., `VoxelCastle::World::Biome`)

**STANDARD ENFORCEMENT PROTOCOL:**
1. **Every function/method name MUST use `PascalCase`** - NO exceptions
2. **Every class/struct/enum name MUST use `PascalCase`** - NO exceptions  
3. **If you encounter inconsistent naming during development:**
   - **STOP immediately** and raise the issue to the user
   - **State exactly what naming inconsistency was found**
   - **Ask for confirmation** before proceeding with fixes
   - **Example:** "I found function `isValidBiomeType()` which should be `IsValidBiomeType()` per our standard. Should I fix this naming inconsistency?"
4. **All new code MUST follow the standard from the start**
5. **All existing code MUST be updated to follow the standard when touched**

**ISSUE ESCALATION:**
- If you find naming that doesn't match the standard: **ASK THE USER IMMEDIATELY**
- If you're unsure about capitalization: **ASK THE USER IMMEDIATELY**  
- If build errors occur due to naming: **CHECK THE STANDARD FIRST, THEN FIX**

This standard is **NON-NEGOTIABLE** and prevents the recurring capitalization build errors we've experienced.

### **üö® CRITICAL: Technical Debt Prevention Protocol**

**NEVER implement "quick fixes" for performance or architectural issues without user consultation.**

**When encountering complex technical problems:**
1. **Reason through the problem systematically** - understand root causes
2. **Brainstorm multiple solution approaches** - consider trade-offs
3. **Present options to user with analysis** - architectural implications
4. **Discuss long-term maintainability** - avoid technical debt
5. **Get explicit approval** before implementing significant changes

**Example Issues Requiring Consultation:**
- Performance bottlenecks affecting user experience
- Architectural decisions with multiple valid approaches  
- Trade-offs between code complexity and feature quality
- Memory/CPU optimization strategies
- Threading and concurrency architecture

**Rationale**: Quick fixes typically create technical debt, maintenance burden, and future architectural constraints. Better to solve problems correctly once than repeatedly patch symptoms.

### III. Problem Solving & Iteration
*   **Focused Approach:** Address one problem or feature at a time. If issues are tightly coupled, they can be addressed together, but this should be explicitly stated.
*   **Avoid Repetitive Fixes:** If a particular fix or approach is attempted multiple times without success, pause, re-evaluate the problem, and consider alternative diagnostic steps or solutions. State what has been tried and why it might not be working.
*   **Persistence:** If a problem persists after initial attempts, search for solutions online before repeatedly asking for help or trying the same fix.
*   **Integrate Changes:** After each logical fix or feature increment, ensure changes are metaphorically "submitted" (i.e., confirmed and integrated).

### III. Key Reminders & Tool Usage
*   **üö® CRITICAL: ALWAYS use `clear &&` before terminal commands** - This is ESSENTIAL for maintaining context window and improving output readability. NEVER run commands without clearing first.
*   **üö® CRITICAL: ALWAYS ask for output if not received** - Never try commands twice. If output isn't shown, explicitly ask "What was the output of that command?"
*   **üö® CRITICAL: ALWAYS check the current path before running commands** - If commands fail, verify that you're in the correct directory path. The working directory for terminal commands may vary depending on the context.
*   **Direct Tool Usage:** Always execute necessary commands directly using the appropriate tool (e.g., `run_in_terminal`, `insert_edit_into_file`). Do not ask the user to run commands manually.
*   **File Modifications:** Use `insert_edit_into_file` for all file changes, providing clear explanations.
*   **üî§ NAMING/CAPITALIZATION STANDARD:**
    *   **C++ Code**: PascalCase for classes/structs/enums (BiomeType, BiomeData, BiomeRegistry), camelCase for functions/variables (getBiomeName, temperatureRange), UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants/enum values (PLAINS, DESERT, FOREST)
    *   **Files**: snake_case for all filenames (biome_types.h, biome_registry.cpp)
    *   **Directories**: snake_case for directory names (world/biome/, engine/include/)
    *   **üö® ENFORCEMENT**: If you encounter code that doesn't follow this standard, immediately raise the issue and suggest corrections. This includes variable names, function names, class names, file names, and directory structures. Consistency is crucial for maintainability.
*   **Logging Guidelines:** 
    *   **Log Files Only:** All detailed debugging information, error traces, and verbose output should be written to log files using the existing logging system (DEBUG_LOG(), VoxelCastle::Utils::logToFile(), etc.)
    *   **Use Existing System:** Leverage the current logging infrastructure rather than std::cout for debugging information
*   **Visual Testability Principle:** 
    *   **Immediate Feedback Requirement:** Every feature implementation must include visual feedback mechanisms that allow developers to see the effects of their changes immediately in-game
    *   **Interactive Testing Tools:** When implementing any system, include debug UI elements (sliders, toggles, overlays, inspectors) that enable real-time experimentation and validation
    *   **Component Isolation:** Design testing tools that allow individual components to be tested in isolation with clear visual indicators of their behavior
    *   **Progressive Validation:** Each implementation phase should have specific visual checkpoints that confirm the feature works as expected before proceeding
*   **Build and Run Instructions (Reference):**
    *   Project Root: `/home/system-x1/Projects/Voxel Castle/`
    *   Build: `clear && cmake --build "/home/system-x1/Projects/Voxel Castle/build"`
    *   Run: `clear && "/home/system-x1/Projects/Voxel Castle/build/bin/VoxelFortressGame"`
