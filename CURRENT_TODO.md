# CURRENT_TODO.md - Active Development Tracking

## üöÄ Current Focus: Building Custom C++ Engine Components

This file tracks our immediate high-level tasks and progress. Detailed sub-tasks for each item are located in corresponding files within the `/home/system-x1/Projects/Voxel Castle/development_tasks/` directory.

**IMPORTANT: This file is updated after each major development step is confirmed as complete by the user. The agent works from detailed sub-task files.**

## ü§ñ Agent Workflow & Prompting Guidelines

**Core Principle:** The AI agent (GitHub Copilot) will assist in development by breaking down tasks, generating code/documentation, and executing commands. The user provides oversight, makes key decisions, and confirms completion of steps.

**Workflow:**

1.  **High-Level Tasks:** `CURRENT_TODO.md` lists the major development phases and tasks.
2.  **Detailed Sub-Tasks:** Each high-level task in this file will have a corresponding detailed Markdown file in the `development_tasks/` directory (e.g., `development_tasks/01_core_engine_foundation/01_set_up_project_structure.md`).
    *   If a detailed sub-task file does not exist when a high-level task is started, the agent will create it, outlining the specific steps, considerations, and self-prompting needed to complete that item.
3.  **Execution Focus:** The agent will primarily work from the detailed sub-task files.
4.  **User Confirmation:**
    *   The agent will confirm individual significant actions or outputs from the sub-task file with the user.
    *   Once all sub-steps within a detailed task file are completed and confirmed, the agent will propose marking the corresponding high-level task in *this* `CURRENT_TODO.md` as complete.
    *   The user must confirm before the high-level task is marked `[x]`.
5.  **File Modifications:** The agent will use the `insert_edit_into_file` tool for changes, providing clear explanations.
6.  **Command Execution:** The agent will use `run_in_terminal` for shell commands, with explanations.

**Bug Fixing & Iteration (Incorporating `MUST-READ-Prompt-Fixing-Bugs.txt` principles):**

*   **One Problem at a Time:** Address issues or implement features in focused, manageable chunks.
*   **Interconnected Problems:** If multiple issues are tightly coupled, they can be addressed together, but this should be explicitly stated.
*   **Submit Changes:** After each logical fix or feature increment, ensure changes are metaphorically "submitted" (i.e., confirmed and integrated).
*   **Document:** Record findings, solutions, and design decisions in relevant documentation (this includes the detailed sub-task files or other `org/` documents).
*   **Break Down Complexity:** Decompose complex problems into smaller, sequential steps (this is the primary purpose of the detailed sub-task files).
*   **Test Thoroughly:** After each significant change, verify (conceptually, or via actual tests if applicable) that the intended outcome is achieved and no regressions were introduced.

## üß† Note to Self (Agent & User)
**WE MUST update this file and the relevant detailed task files after each development step!** This ensures we maintain focus on the most important tasks, have clear visibility into progress, and can adapt our plan as new information becomes available. The active task list should always reflect the current state of development.

**DOCUMENTATION IS CRUCIAL!** With every implementation step, we must update relevant documentation to explain design decisions, patterns used, and architectural considerations. This includes:
1. Updating existing documentation files (`org/` directory)
2. Creating/updating detailed task files in `development_tasks/`
3. Creating new documentation for new systems
4. Adding code comments for complex algorithms
5. Creating diagrams for system interactions when appropriate

**TEST REGULARLY!** We must compile and run the code after implementing each significant feature or component to ensure it works as expected. Never let untested code accumulate - this helps identify issues early when they're easier to fix. After implementing:
1. A new module or system ‚Üí Compile and run to test it works
2. Changes to existing functionality ‚Üí Verify nothing broke
3. Complex algorithms or critical systems ‚Üí Add specific tests
4. Multiple components ‚Üí Test their integration together

**MAINTAIN SMALL, FOCUSED FILES!** We must keep individual source files small, focused, and well-organized to facilitate better development. This approach:
1. Makes it easier to comprehend the codebase in smaller chunks
2. Reduces context overload when working on specific features
3. Allows us to pinpoint exactly what code I need to reference
4. Promotes better separation of concerns and modularity
5. Results in more maintainable and testable code
