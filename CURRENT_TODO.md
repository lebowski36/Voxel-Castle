# CURRENT_TODO.md - Active Development Tracking

## üöÄ Current Focus: Building Custom C++ Engine Components

This file tracks our immediate high-level tasks and progress. Detailed sub-tasks for each item are located in corresponding files within the `/home/system-x1/Projects/Voxel Castle/development_tasks/` directory.

**IMPORTANT: This file is updated after each major development step is confirmed as complete by the user. The agent works from detailed sub-task files.**

## ü§ñ Agent Workflow & Prompting Guidelines

**Core Principle:** The AI agent (GitHub Copilot) will assist in development by breaking down tasks, generating code/documentation, and executing commands. The user provides oversight, makes key decisions, and confirms completion of steps.

**Workflow:**

1.  **High-Level Tasks:** `CURRENT_TODO.md` lists the major development phases and tasks.
2.  **Detailed Sub-Tasks:** Each high-level task in this file will have a corresponding detailed Markdown file in the `development_tasks/` directory (e.g., `development_tasks/01_core_engine_foundation/01_set_up_project_structure.md`).
    *   If a detailed sub-task file does not exist when a high-level task is started, the agent will create it, outlining the specific steps, considerations, and self-prompting needed to complete that item.
    *   Within these detailed task files, sub-tasks can be further broken down using a hierarchical numbering scheme (e.g., 2.1, 2.1.1, 2.1.2, 2.2) for clarity if needed.
3.  **Execution Focus:** The agent will primarily work from the detailed sub-task files.
4.  **User Confirmation & Involvement:**
    *   The agent will confirm individual significant actions or outputs from the sub-task file with the user.
    *   **Crucial decisions (e.g., library choices, major architectural changes) MUST be discussed and confirmed with the user before proceeding.**
    *   Once all sub-steps within a detailed task file are completed and confirmed, the agent will propose marking the corresponding high-level task in *this* `CURRENT_TODO.md` as complete.
5.  **File Modifications:** The agent will use the `insert_edit_into_file` tool for changes, providing clear explanations.
6.  **Command Execution:** The agent will use `run_in_terminal` for shell commands, with explanations.

**Bug Fixing & Iteration (Incorporating `MUST-READ-Prompt-Fixing-Bugs.txt` principles):**

*   **One Problem at a Time:** Address issues or implement features in focused, manageable chunks.
*   **Interconnected Problems:** If multiple issues are tightly coupled, they can be addressed together, but this should be explicitly stated.
*   **Submit Changes:** After each logical fix or feature increment, ensure changes are metaphorically "submitted" (i.e., confirmed and integrated).
*   **Document:** Record findings, solutions, and design decisions in relevant documentation (this includes the detailed sub-task files or other `org/` documents).
*   **Break Down Complexity:** Decompose complex problems into smaller, sequential steps (this is the primary purpose of the detailed sub-task files).
*   **Test Thoroughly:** After each significant change, verify (conceptually, or via actual tests if applicable) that the intended outcome is achieved and no regressions were introduced.

## üîÑ Active Tasks (New C++ Phase)

**Note on Task Completion:** A main task item (e.g., `- [ ] Implement camera system`) in the lists below is marked as complete (`[x]`) if and only if all its constituent sub-tasks, as detailed in its corresponding markdown file within the `development_tasks/` directory, have been completed and verified.

### 1. Core Engine Foundation (C++)

## üìù Near-Term Priority Tasks
*This section should be updated regularly with the most immediate goals, typically pointing to the current high-level task from the list above.*

### ‚úÖ Greedy Meshing Debug & Verification (May 11, 2025)

- [x] **Analyzed test failures** for `buildGreedyMesh` in `game/src/main.cpp` and implementation in `engine/src/rendering/mesh_builder.cpp`.
- [x] **Identified** that only one face direction per axis was being generated (classic greedy meshing bug).
- [x] **Updated implementation** to sweep both positive and negative face directions for each axis.
- [x] **Adjusted mask and face-detection logic** to ensure all exposed faces are generated.
- [x] **Cleaned up and clarified** the greedy meshing loop for maintainability.
- [x] **Built the project** and ran all mesh generation tests.
- [x] **Confirmed all greedy meshing tests now PASS** (single block, lines, planes, cubes).
- [x] **Verified mesh vertex and index counts** match expected values for all test cases.
- [x] **Confirmed no regressions** in naive meshing or voxel system tests.

**Summary:**
Greedy meshing is now correct and fully tested. All mesh generation tests pass, and the implementation is robust for all basic voxel shapes. Documentation and task tracking have been updated accordingly.

## üß† Note to Self (Agent)
**Agent Self-Correction/Reminder:** Per user instruction, I will always execute necessary commands directly using the appropriate tool. I will not ask the user to run commands manually.

**Autonomous Operation Mandate & Testing Protocol:** My primary mode of operation is to work autonomously through the defined sub-tasks. I will continue coding, implementing features, and resolving issues independently. However, I will pause and await user interaction under the following circumstances:
1.  A critical design decision with multiple viable options requires user input.
2.  Specific feedback on a completed segment of work is needed before proceeding.
3.  A question arises that genuinely blocks progress and cannot be resolved through available context or research.
4.  An unrecoverable error or significant unexpected behavior is encountered during development or testing.
5.  **After implementing a significant feature, component, or a set of related changes, I will initiate a build and/or relevant tests (which includes running the main executable if applicable to observe behavior). I will then pause and explicitly await user confirmation of the build/test results (success, failure, or observations) before proceeding to the next task. I will not move on if a test fails or if the outcome is unclear without user feedback.**

**Testing Best Practices (To be followed diligently):**
*   **Test Regularly:** Compile and **run the application** after implementing each significant feature or component to ensure it works as expected. Never let untested code accumulate.
    *   After a new module or system: Compile and run to test it works.
    *   After changes to existing functionality: Verify nothing broke by running the application.
    *   After complex algorithms or critical systems: Add specific tests if feasible, or at least perform thorough manual checks by running and observing the application.
    *   After integrating multiple components: Test their integration together by running the application.
*   **Awaiting Test Output:** If I'm unable to see the complete output from a command I've run (especially build outputs or error messages), I **must wait for the user to provide the results** before proceeding.

**General Operational Guidelines:**
*   **ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL: Clear Console with Command!** Before executing any new command in the terminal that produces significant output (especially builds or tests), I **MUST** prepend the `clear` command to the main command, joined by `&&` (e.g., `clear && cmake --build build`). This ensures the console is cleared immediately before the intended command runs, preventing output from previous commands from obscuring the new results. I will explicitly state that the command includes clearing the console.
*   **CRITICAL - Update Task Files:** I **MUST ALWAYS** update this file (`CURRENT_TODO.md`) and, most importantly, the relevant detailed task files in `development_tasks/` (by checking off completed sub-tasks and updating their status) after each development step is confirmed complete. **Sub-tasks themselves should be maintained within their specific detailed markdown files, not duplicated or expanded in this `CURRENT_TODO.md` file.** This `CURRENT_TODO.md` file should only list the main high-level tasks. This is paramount for accurate progress tracking and ensuring I don\'t repeat or miss steps.
*   **Consult Design Documents:** Before implementing new features or making significant design choices, I will consult the relevant documents in the `/home/system-x1/Projects/Voxel Castle/docs/design_specifications/` directory (including `Voxel Fortress Tech Stack (C++ Custom Engine Approach).md`, `Voxel Fortress Game Concept Details.md`, and other related files) to ensure my work aligns with the established project vision, architecture, and technical guidelines.
*   **Crucial Decisions:** ALWAYS CONFIRM CRUCIAL DECISIONS WITH THE USER. Before making significant choices (e.g., selecting a library, deciding on a core architectural pattern), present the options, your recommendation (if any), and ask for the user's input and confirmation.
*   **Problem Persistence:** IF A PROBLEM PERSISTS after initial attempts, I will search for solutions online before asking the user for help or trying the same fix repeatedly.
*   **Documentation:** DOCUMENTATION IS CRUCIAL! With every implementation step, update relevant documentation.
*   **Small, Focused Files:** MAINTAIN SMALL, FOCUSED FILES for better organization and maintainability.
