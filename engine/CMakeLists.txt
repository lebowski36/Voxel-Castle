# --- GLAD --- 
# If you are building GLAD from source directly within this target (not recommended for modularity)
# you would add its .c file to add_library and its include path to target_include_directories.

# If GLAD is built as a separate library (e.g., in external/glad with its own CMakeLists.txt)
# you would link against it: target_link_libraries(VoxelEngine PRIVATE glad)
# And ensure its include directory is propagated: target_include_directories(VoxelEngine PUBLIC/PRIVATE path/to/glad/include)

# For now, assuming GLAD headers will be made available globally or handled by the user.
# If you have downloaded GLAD and put it in, for example, 'external/glad_src_and_include':
# target_sources(VoxelEngine PRIVATE ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/external/glad_src_and_include/src/glad.c)
# target_include_directories(VoxelEngine PUBLIC ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/external/glad_src_and_include/include)
