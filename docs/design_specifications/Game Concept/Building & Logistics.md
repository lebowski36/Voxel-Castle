# Building & Logistics

## Overview
The Building & Logistics system forms a cornerstone of Voxel Fortress gameplay, enabling players to shape the physical environment to meet their colony's needs. This system governs how structures are designed, constructed, and utilized, as well as how resources and colonists move throughout the environment, creating a dynamic and functional colony.
