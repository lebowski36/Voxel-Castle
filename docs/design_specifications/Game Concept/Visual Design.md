## Technical Considerations

### Art Pipeline

#### Asset Creation Workflow
- **Modeling Approach:** Block modeling techniques and tools. The C++ engine will need to support common 3D model formats (e.g., .obj, .fbx, .gltf) if pre-made assets are used, or have tools/APIs for procedural generation of block-based geometry.
- **Texturing Standards:** Resolution, color depth, file format specifications (e.g., PNG, DDS for compressed textures). The C++ rendering system will need to load and manage these textures.
- **Animation Systems:** Rigging and animation approach for characters. The C++ engine would need an animation system capable of playing back skeletal animations, possibly with blending and state machines.
- **Integration Process:** Workflow from art creation to game implementation. This involves C++ tools or scripts for asset conversion, packing, and loading into the game engine.

#### Style Guide Documentation
- **Color Palettes:** Defined color schemes with RGB values. These can be stored in C++ data structures or configuration files.
- **Texture Standards:** Pattern libraries and texture creation guidelines.
- **Proportional Systems:** Size relationships and scaling rules.
- **Visual Language Reference:** Collected examples of the approved style.

#### Performance Optimization
- **Texture Atlas System:** Efficient packing of textures to minimize draw calls. The C++ rendering engine would implement or use libraries for texture atlasing.
- **LOD Management:** Appropriate detail reduction for distant elements. The C++ engine's rendering and culling systems will manage LOD transitions.
- **Polygon Budget:** Guidelines for model complexity at different scales.
- **Effect Limitations:** Parameters for particle systems and visual effects, managed by the C++ particle and effects systems.

### Rendering Techniques

#### Material System
- **PBR vs. Stylized:** Appropriate rendering approach for the game's aesthetic. The C++ engine's material system would define shader properties and how they are interpreted (e.g., using GLSL, HLSL, or SPIR-V shaders).
- **Shader Complexity:** Balance between visual quality and performance. Shaders are written in languages like GLSL/HLSL and compiled for the GPU, managed by the C++ application.
- **Material Properties:** Consistent system for representing different substances (e.g., roughness, metallic, emissive values in C++ data structures passed to shaders).
- **Surface Detail:** Normal mapping, ambient occlusion, and other techniques implemented via shaders.

#### Lighting Model
- **Global Illumination:** Approach to ambient light and indirect lighting. Could range from simple ambient terms to more complex C++ implementations of SSAO, light probes, or even ray-traced GI if the engine supports it.
- **Dynamic Lighting:** Handling of moving light sources and shadows (e.g., shadow mapping techniques implemented in C++ and shaders).
- **Time of Day:** Implementation of natural lighting cycles, driven by C++ game logic updating light parameters.
- **Underground Lighting:** Specialized approach for subterranean environments, possibly using different light attenuation models or ambient settings in C++.

#### Special Rendering Features
- **Volumetrics:** Fog, god rays, and atmospheric effects, implemented as C++ post-processing effects or volumetric rendering techniques.
- **Reflections:** Water surfaces and other reflective materials (e.g., screen-space reflections, reflection probes implemented in C++).
- **Transparency Handling:** Layered transparency and alpha sorting, managed by the C++ rendering pipeline.
- **Post-Processing:** Color grading, bloom, and other image enhancements applied as shader passes in C++.
