MUST-READ INSTRUCTIONS FOR FIXING BUGS

When fixing bugs in this codebase, follow these guidelines:

1. Fix one problem at a time for clarity and precision
2. If multiple problems are interconnected, they can be fixed together
3. After fixing each problem, submit the changes before moving to the next issue
4. Document findings and solutions in appropriate markdown files
5. Break down complex issues into manageable steps
6. Test thoroughly after each fix to ensure it resolves the intended issue

This approach will help maintain a clean history of changes and make troubleshooting more systematic.
