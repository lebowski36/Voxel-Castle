# Project Prompt & Progress Tracker

## Decision Policy
- All significant decisions, design changes, or new features must be clarified and confirmed with the user before implementation.
- No assumptions should be made about user intent; always ask for clarification if uncertain.

## Project Summary
- **Project Name:** Voxel Fortress
- **Engine:** Rust + Bevy
- **Current Features:**
  - 3D camera with WSAD and arrow key movement (forward/back/left/right, rotation)
  - Procedural ground plane and grid of cubes
  - Basic lighting
- **Planned Features:**
  - Expand camera controls (mouse look, up/down movement, etc.)
  - Voxel terrain generation
  - Entity/component systems for simulation
  - UI and interaction systems

## Progress Log
- **2025-04-22:**
  - Fixed camera controls: ArrowUp/ArrowDown now move forward/backward.
  - Created this prompt/progress file.
  - REMEMBER: When the user asks you to remember something, write it to the prompt file (PROMPT.md).
  - REMEMBER: When you write any comments, run the comments yourself and do not tell the user to do it themselves.
- **2025-04-22 (cont.):**
  - Decided to implement chunked voxel world generation and visualization based on project documentation.
  - Chunk size: 32x32x32 voxels (25cm per voxel, 8mÂ³ per chunk).
  - Will start with a minimal chunked world (one or a few chunks, all solid or with a simple heightmap), then iterate.
  - Documentation and design files updated to reflect this plan.
  - Next: Implement basic chunk data structure and worldgen, then update visualization to render generated chunks.
- **2025-04-23:**
  - Started design and implementation of a basic Level of Detail (LOD) and chunk streaming system.
  - Created `feature_docs/chunk_lod_streaming.md` to document the plan, motivation, and steps for LOD/streaming.
  - Next: Design chunk states and LOD levels, then implement chunk state tracking and update logic in `ChunkManager`.

## Current Step
- Implementing a hierarchical world generation system: the world is divided into multiple levels of chunks (superchunks, regions, block chunks), with high-level worldgen (biomes, heightmaps, etc.) at the top and detailed block data generated on demand at the lowest level.
- Data structures and interfaces for hierarchical chunk addressing and worldgen are being added to support Earth-sized, LOD-friendly, and streamable worlds.
- All code is being kept modular and extensible for future features.

## Next Steps
- Clarify with user which feature or improvement to prioritize next (e.g., mouse look, vertical movement, voxel terrain, etc.).
- Document and log all future changes and decisions here.
- After implementing any new feature or significant change, always run the game to verify the update works as intended.
- If any issues or errors occur, troubleshoot and resolve them before considering the task complete.

---
**Note:** This file should be updated with every significant change, feature addition, or design decision. Always consult and confirm with the user before proceeding with new steps. User wants the PROMPT.md file to always be started and updated with every significant change, and for me to remember this as a standing instruction.

- We have additional documentation in the `feature_docs` folder and in the `org/Game Concept` folder. For any key design or implementation decisions, always check and reference these documents if relevant guidance is defined there.
