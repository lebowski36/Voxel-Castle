# UI System Fix Documentation

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Import Problems
- Simplified imports to just use `bevy::prelude::*` which includes all needed UI components
- Removed redundant imports that were causing "cannot find struct" errors

### 2. Bevy 0.15.3 API Changes
- Identified that Bevy 0.15.3 has changed the UI component structure
- NodeBundle, TextBundle, and ButtonBundle are now used differently
- The component structure requires adaptation to the current Bevy version

### 3. Text Handling
- Fixed text rendering function calls
- Updated from `TextBundle::from_section` to use the correct API

### 4. Color Methods
- Changed deprecated `Color::rgb` and `Color::rgba` to use `Color::srgb` and `Color::srgba`

### 5. Button Interaction
- Implemented proper button interaction systems
- Added component markers for each button type

## Approach
Following the "fix one problem at a time" guideline, we're addressing each issue category separately to ensure clarity and maintainability.
