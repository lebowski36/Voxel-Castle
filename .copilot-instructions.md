# Voxel Castle Development Instructions

## Core Architecture Constants
Chunks are always 32x32x32 voxels (each voxel is 0.25m, so each chunk is 8m x 8m x 8m).
Voxel size: 0.25m (25cm cubes)
Target: 60 FPS (dynamic LOD as needed)
Coordinate system: Y-up, right-handed; global positions use 64-bit integers.
Technology stack: C++17, OpenGL 3.3+, Flecs ECS, CMake.
Architecture: Flecs ECS for entity management, RAII for resource management, modular chunked world, greedy meshing, LOD.
## Code Standards
- C++17 standard
- Use smart pointers (shared_ptr, unique_ptr)
- RAII for resource management
- Flecs ECS for entity management
- OpenGL 3.3+ core profile
- GLM for math operations

## Naming Conventions
- Classes: PascalCase (VoxelChunk, MeshGenerator)
- Functions: camelCase (generateMesh, updateChunk)
- Variables: camelCase (chunkPosition, voxelData)
- Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (CHUNK_SIZE, MAX_RENDER_DISTANCE)
- Files: PascalCase.hpp/.cpp

## Performance Requirements
- Maintain 60 FPS target
- Use greedy meshing for voxel rendering
- Implement proper LOD for distant chunks
- Background mesh generation threading
- Efficient memory management

## Block System
- Use JSON-driven block definitions
- Auto-generated C++ enums and properties
- Texture atlas system with 256 slot capacity
- Face patterns: uniform, grass, log types
