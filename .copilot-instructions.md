# GitHub Copilot Instructions for VoxelFortress

## Core AI Programming Philosophy

**CRITICAL PRINCIPLES - NEVER ASSUME, ALWAYS ASK:**
- When uncertain about behavior, root causes, or requirements, ASK the human for clarification instead of making assumptions
- Never break existing functionality - thoroughly understand before changing
- Build incrementally with small, testable changes that build toward larger goals
- Document everything with clear rationale and impact assessment
- Follow established patterns and architectural decisions
- Think systemically - consider impact across the entire codebase

**Manual Re-Reading Requirement**: This workflow must be re-read and internalized after any period of not working with it to ensure continued alignment with established practices.

## AI Agent Operational Protocol

### Core Collaborative Workflow (The Primary Loop)
1. **Task Identification**: Focus on a single, open sub-task from relevant `development_tasks/*.md` file
   - If detailed sub-task file missing for new high-level task, create it first, outlining steps
   - **If sub-task involves multiple distinct steps or actions, break it down into clearly defined sub-sub-tasks within the `development_tasks/*.md` file before starting implementation**

2. **Implementation**: Perform coding, documentation, or other actions required for the sub-task
   - Consult design documents in `docs/design_specifications/` for new features/major changes
   - Maintain small, focused files

3. **Execution & Testing**:
   - Run necessary commands using `run_in_terminal` tool with explanation
   - **CRITICAL COMMAND EXECUTION**: Always prepend `clear &&` to commands producing significant output (e.g., `clear && cmake --build ...`)
   - State that console is being cleared
   - Test thoroughly after each significant change to verify outcomes and check for regressions by running the application or specific tests

4. **User Confirmation & Decision Making**:
   - Pause and explicitly await user confirmation of build/test results (success, failure, observations)
   - **CRUCIAL DECISIONS**: Discuss and confirm ALL crucial decisions (e.g., library choices, major architectural changes), unrecoverable errors, or blocking questions with the user BEFORE proceeding
   - If command output is incomplete or unclear, await user clarification before proceeding
   - **TASK COMPLETION CONFIRMATION: The agent MUST NOT mark any task or sub-task as complete in ANY `.md` file (including `development_tasks` files or `CURRENT_TODO.md`) without first proposing the completion to the user and receiving an explicit affirmative response (e.g., "yes", "okay", "confirmed"). The agent should state what it believes is complete and ask "Is it okay to mark this as complete?"**

5. **Task & Documentation Update (Post-User Confirmation)**:
   - **Only after explicit user confirmation (see point 4 above),** use `insert_edit_into_file` to mark the sub-task as complete in the `development_tasks/*.md` file
   - If all sub-tasks for a high-level task are done, propose updating `CURRENT_TODO.md` to mark the high-level task complete (again, requiring explicit user confirmation)
   - Document findings, solutions, and design decisions in relevant files (task files, `docs/` files)

6. **Progression**: Proceed to next open sub-task. If any part of the process or a specific task is unclear, ask for clarification

### Problem Solving Guidelines
- **Focused Approach**: Address one problem or feature at a time. If issues are tightly coupled, they can be addressed together, but this should be explicitly stated
- **Avoid Repetitive Fixes**: If a particular fix or approach is attempted multiple times without success, pause, re-evaluate the problem, and consider alternative diagnostic steps or solutions. State what has been tried and why it might not be working
- **Persistence**: If a problem persists after initial attempts, search for solutions online before repeatedly asking for help or trying the same fix
- **Integrate Changes**: After each logical fix or feature increment, ensure changes are metaphorically "submitted" (i.e., confirmed and integrated)

### Key Reminders & Tool Usage
- **Direct Tool Usage**: Always execute necessary commands directly using the appropriate tool (e.g., `run_in_terminal`, `insert_edit_into_file`). Do not ask the user to run commands manually
- **File Modifications**: Use `insert_edit_into_file` for all file changes, providing clear explanations

### Command Reference
- **Project Root**: `/home/system-x1/Projects/Voxel Castle/`
- **Build**: `clear && cmake --build "/home/system-x1/Projects/Voxel Castle/build"`
- **Run**: `clear && "/home/system-x1/Projects/Voxel Castle/build/bin/VoxelFortressGame"`

## Universal Development Workflow

### Phase 1: Context Gathering and Analysis (10-15% of task time)
1. **Project Understanding**
   - Read all project documentation (README, DEVELOPMENT, ROADMAP, CURRENT_TODO)
   - Map existing architecture and system relationships
   - Identify coding standards and patterns in use

2. **Task Analysis**
   - Break complex requests into specific, measurable sub-tasks
   - Identify all affected systems and potential integration points
   - **ASK instead of ASSUME** when uncertain about requirements

3. **Codebase Exploration**
   - Use semantic search to understand existing implementations
   - Follow established naming conventions and file organization

### Phase 2: Strategic Planning (15-20% of task time)
1. **Create Working Document**
   - Always create helper file for complex tasks (like UI_SYSTEM_ANALYSIS.md)
   - Document understanding, theories, and planned approach
   - Establish clear milestones and checkpoints

2. **Risk Assessment**
   - What could go wrong?
   - What are the unknowns?
   - What are the dependencies?

3. **Implementation Strategy**
   - Design changes that respect existing architecture
   - Plan for backward compatibility and minimal disruption
   - Define success criteria and testing approach
   - Break down into small, testable increments
   - Define fallback approaches
   - Plan verification steps

### Phase 3: Incremental Implementation (60-70% of task time)
1. **Start Simple, Build Complexity**
   - Always begin with the simplest possible working version
   - Add complexity incrementally
   - Test after every meaningful change

2. **Diagnostic-First Development**
   - Create simple test cases to verify understanding
   - Implement minimal versions to validate approach
   - Use visual debugging (bright colors, logging) when helpful
   - Build and test after each significant change

3. **Follow Build-Test-Verify Cycle**
   - Make one focused change
   - Build immediately: `clear && cmake --build "/home/system-x1/Projects/Voxel Castle/build"`
   - Test: `clear && "/home/system-x1/Projects/Voxel Castle/build/bin/VoxelFortressGame"`
   - Verify the change worked as expected
   - Document findings and proceed

4. **Maintain Integration Integrity**
   - Ensure changes don't break existing functionality
   - Keep the project in a runnable state
   - Update documentation as you go

5. **Progressive Enhancement**
   - Start with core functionality, add features incrementally
   - Maintain working state at each step
   - Document unexpected issues and solutions
   - Refactor when patterns become clear

### Phase 4: Validation & Documentation (10-15% of task time)
1. **Comprehensive Testing**
   - Test happy path scenarios and edge cases
   - Test boundary conditions and error scenarios
   - Verify performance impact is acceptable
   - Ensure proper error handling and resource management
   - Validate against original requirements

2. **Code Quality Assurance**
   - Follow established coding standards and best practices
   - Remove debug code and clean up temporary implementations
   - Ensure proper commenting and self-documenting code
   - Verify all error paths and edge cases

3. **Update Documentation**
   - Update task files to reflect completion
   - Document design decisions and trade-offs
   - Create usage examples and integration guides
   - Document known limitations and future improvement areas
   - Record lessons learned for future reference

4. **User Handoff Preparation**
   - Prepare clear explanation of what was accomplished
   - Identify what the user should see/experience
   - Document any remaining work or known issues
